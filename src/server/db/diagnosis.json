[{"title": "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "section": "1.2", "clinical_case": "Brandon was a 12-year-old boy brought in by his mother for psychiatric evaluation for temper tantrums that seemed to be contributing to declining school performance. The mother became emotional as she reported that things had always been difficult but had become worse after Brandon entered middle school. Shortly after starting middle school, Brandon had started complaining of stomachaches on school-day mornings and was often reluctant to go to school.Brandon's sixth-grade teachers reported that he was academically capable but that he had little ability to make friends. He seemed to mistrust the intentions of classmates who tried to be nice to him but attempted to befriend others who laughingly feigned interest in the toy cars and trucks that he brought to school. The teachers noted that he often cried and rarely spoke in class. In recent months, multiple teachers had heard him screaming at other boys, generally in the hallway but sometimes in the middle of class.The teachers had not identified a cause but generally had not disciplined Brandon because they assumed he was responding to provocation. He was embarrassed about these outbursts and did not want to go to swim practice because he did not want his swim friends to ask why he'd had an outburst at school.When interviewed alone, Brandon responded with nonspontaneous mumbles when asked questions about school, classmates, and his family. When the examiner asked if he was interested in toy cars, however, Brandon lit up. He pulled several cars, trucks, and airplanes from his backpack and, while not making good eye contact, did talk at length about vehicles, using their apparently accurate names (e.g., front-end loader, B-52, Jaguar). When asked again about school, Brandon pulled out his cell phone and showed a string of text messages: \"dumbo!!!!\" \"mr stutter\"; \"LoSeR\"; \"freak!\"; \"EVERYBODYHATES YOU.\" While the examiner read the long string of texts that Brandon had saved but apparently not previously revealed, Brandon added that other boys would whisper \"bad words\" to him in class and then scream in his ears in the hall. \"And I hate loud noises.\" He also told the examiner that he sometimes wished that he had never been born.Developmentally, Brandon spoke his first word at age 11 months and began to use short sentences by age 3. He had always been very focused on trucks, cars, and trains.According to his mother, he had always been \"very shy\" and had never had a best friend. As he has gotten older, it has become more apparent that he struggles with jokes and typical young adolescent banter because \"he takes things so literally.\" Brandon's mother had long seen this behavior as \"a little odd\" but added that it was not much different from that of Brandon's father, a successful attorney, who had similarly focused interests. Both of them were \"sticklers for routine\" who \"lacked a sense of humor.\" Brandon's mother noted that he made efforts to conceal his interest in trucks, cars, and trains outside of the home but would eagerly speak about them when encouraged. Brandon has shared with his mother that he tries to appear \"normal\" when interacting with peers at school, which is exhausting. He often feels nervous around peers and generally tries to avoid socializing.On examination, Brandon was shy and generally nonspontaneous. He made below- average eye contact. His speech was coherent and goal directed. At times, Brandon stumbled over his words, paused excessively, and sometimes rapidly repeated words or parts of words. Brandon said he felt okay but added that he was scared of school, particularly when around other children. He appeared sad, brightening only when discussing his toy cars. He denied current suicidal thoughts or plans as well as homicidality. He denied psychotic symptoms.

"}, {"title": "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "section": "1.3", "clinical_case": "Carlos was a 19-year-old Hispanic college student in his freshman year at a public university in a large city. He was referred by his guidance counselor to the hospital's outpatient psychiatric clinic for help with academic difficulties. Since starting college 6 months earlier, he had done poorly on tests and been unable to manage his study schedule. His worries that he was going to flunk out of college were leading to anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, and a general sense of hopelessness. After a particularly tough week, he told his family that he thought he should quit. His mother accompanied him to the clinic that had previously helped both Carlos and his younger brother. The mother specifically wondered whether Carlos's \"ADHD\" might be causing his problems, or whether he had outgrown it.Carlos had been seen at the same clinic when he was age 9, at which time he had been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominantlycombined type. Notes from that clinical evaluation indicated that Carlos had been in trouble at school for not following instructions, not completing homework, getting out of his seat, losing things, not waiting his turn, and not listening. He had trouble concentrating except in regard to video games, which he \"could play for hours.\" Carlos had apparently been slow to talk, but his birth and developmental histories were otherwise normal. He repeated first grade because of behavioral immaturity and difficulty learning to read. The ease with which Carlos learned English, his second language, was not noted. His family had emigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic when he was 5 years old. The family was Catholic and attended church every Sunday. Both of his parents worked in maintenance and housekeeping at a local municipal hospital.During the evaluation when Carlos was age 9, a psychoeducational assessment by a clinical psychologist confirmed reading problems (particularly problems in reading fluency and comprehension). Carlos did not, however, meet the school board criteria for a learning disability, which required evidence of a 20-point discrepancy between IQ and achievement scores. Thus, he was not eligible for special education services. The evaluator had noted Carlos to be eager to do well and anxious about underperforming.His anxiety was thought to be a reaction to his school difficulties and his challenges in meeting the academic expectations of his family. Carlos's pediatrician had recommended pharmacotherapy, but his parents did not want to pursue medication. They cited negative experiences with local youth who used diverted controlled substances and hung out \"on the street.\" Instead, his mother reported taking on an extra job to pay for tutors to help her son \"with concentration and reading.\" The eldest of four siblings, Carlos had done well with this intervention and was now the first member of his family to attend college.The psychiatry trainee carefully reviewed Carlos's academic history; his symptoms, including the course and severity of sadness, anxiety, insomnia, and hopelessness; and his social and developmental history. She obtained collateral history from his family and school records. She used the revised DSM-5-TR Core Cultural Formulation Interview for assistance in obtaining a better understanding of Carlos's acculturation experiences, the family's past feelings about the clinic's recommendations, and what treatment interventions would be relevant and acceptable to Carlos and his family.The psychiatry trainee learned that Carlos had a childhood history of \"nervousness\" identified by a neighborhood curandera (traditional healer) as ataque de nervios. The family had addressed this problem with supportive prayer and a traditional herbal tea. They had apparently not revealed this to the psychiatrist at the time, thinking he would find it irrelevant and not wishing to seem disrespectful of his authority. During these unrevealed episodes of acute anxiety, Carlos would experience trembling and agitation, palpitations, shortness of breath, dread of harm, and fear of separation from caregivers. Workup by the pediatrician had revealed no physiological cause.Since starting college, Carlos reported that he had frequently been unable to remain focused while reading and listening to lectures. He was easily sidetracked and therefore had difficulty handing in his written assignments on time. He complained of feeling restless, agitated, and worried. He described difficulty falling asleep, poor energy, and an inability to \"have fun\" like his peers. He reported that the depressive symptoms went \"up and down\" over the course of the week and possibly influenced his problems with concentration; it was hard for him to be certain. He denied substance use.Carlos said that he'd had some great teachers in high school who had understood him, helped him get the meaning of what he read, and allowed him to audiotape lectures and use other formats (e.g., videos, wikis, visual presentations) for final assignments.Without this support at college, he said he felt \"lonely, stupid, a failure-unable to cope.\"Although advised by his high school teacher to do so, Carlos had not registered with the university's student disability services office. He preferred not to be seen as different from his peers and thought he should be able to get through college by himself.Carlos's family history was positive for ADHD in a younger brother. A cousin was reported to have had \"dyslexia\" and had dropped out of a local community college after one semester. His social and developmental history revealed that he had been well liked by his cluster of friends throughout school. His group consisted of boys and girls and tended to consist of kids more interested in school than in sports. Carlos denied ever having dated or been sexually active, and he also denied having any significant interest in pursuing either of these activities.On examination, Carlos was well-groomed, polite, and soft-spoken. He wore clean jeans,a T-shirt, and a hoodie that he kept pulling down over his face. He sat quietly and hunched over. He sighed a lot and rarely made eye contact with the clinician. He often tapped his fingers and shuffled in his seat but responded appropriately to questions. His command of English appeared strong, but he spoke with a slight Spanish accent. He often mumbled and mispronounced some multisyllabic words (e.g., he said \"literalchure\" instead of \"literature\" and \"intimate\" when he clearly meant \"intimidate\"). He denied any suicidal thoughts. He appeared motivated to do better. On a follow-up interview with the psychiatry trainee, Carlos asked whether the conversations were confidential. When informed that they were, he hesitantly admitted that he felt overwhelmed by new relationships with college peers. He indicated that \"in my neighborhood growing up, everybody was Dominican, but in college, I'm the only Dominican.\" He also quietly said that he thought he might \"like guys rather than girls.\" He revealed two recent episodes of panic \"like when I was a kid\" that had occurred during social situations. He declined to go into further detail.After these two initial sessions, the psychiatrist suggested extending the evaluation so that they could optimize a treatment strategy. She told Carlos that she wanted to better understand his mood and anxiety symptoms, as well as how he felt about being the first in his family to go to college (i.e., role transitions), and to talk a little more about his concerns about his sexual orientation. She also referred Carlos for updated psychoeducational testing. This psychoeducational reassessment confirmed that Carlos's reading and writing abilities were substantially and quantifiably below those expected for his age. That report also concluded that these learning difficulties were not attributable to intellectual developmental disorder, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, psychosocial adversity, or lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction. The report concluded that Carlos had specific difficulties with reading fluency and comprehension as well as spelling and written expression.", "diagnosis": "\u2022 Major depressive disorder, mild, single episode \n\u2022 History of panic disorder; rule out current \n\u2022 History of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, with predominantly inattentive presentation, of mild to moderate severity; rule out current \n\u2022 Specific learning disorder affecting the domains of reading (both fluency and comprehension) and written expression (spelling and organization of written expression), all currently of moderate severity \n", "llmind_diagnosis": "Based on the information provided, Carlos likely meets the criteria for a diagnosis of **Specific Learning Disorder** (previously known as learning disability) with impaired reading fluency and comprehension, spelling, and written expression.

Dingle, M.D.Daphne, a 13-year-old in the ninth grade, was brought for a psychiatric evaluation because of academic and behavioral struggles. She had particular difficulty starting and completing schoolwork and following instructions, and she had received failing grades in math. When prompted to complete tasks, Daphne became argumentative and irritable.She had become increasingly resistant to attending school, asking to stay home with her mother. These difficulties had been evident since early childhood but had worsened significantly this year. Because Daphne had become increasingly distressed, her parents have been less insistent on making her do any activity that upsets her.Psychological testing indicated that Daphne had above-average intelligence, age- appropriate achievement in all subjects except math, and some difficulties in visuospatial skills. The test results were shared with the school, which offered additional tutoring. Daphne attended only a few sessions, stating that they were not helpful. Her parents talked to the school counselors and Daphne's teachers, asking for more services. They were told repeatedly that Daphne needed to be more assertive and ask for help.Several teachers commented that Daphne should be more motivated and try harder. Several years earlier, her pediatrician had diagnosed ADHD and prescribed a stimulant.She took the medication for a week, but her parents stopped giving it to her because she seemed agitated.At home, Daphne's parents' close supervision of her homework often led to arguments with crying and screaming. Her behavior and attitude were noticeably better when she was out of school. She had two long-standing friends but had made no new close friends for several years. In groups with other children, she preferred to play with those younger than she. When her friends chose the activity or did not follow her rules, she tended to withdraw. She was generally quiet in groups and in school but more interactive with family members and individuals she knew well.Since early childhood, Daphne has had difficulty falling asleep, requiring a nightlight and parental reassurance. Recognizing that Daphne was easily upset by change, her parents rarely forced her into new activities. She did well during the summer, which she spent with her grandparents. Her parents reported no particular traumas, stressors, or developmental or medical problems. Daphne had started her menses about 2 months prior to the evaluation. Her family history was pertinent for multiple first- and second- degree relatives with mood, anxiety, or learning disorders.At first meeting, Daphne was shy and tense. Her eye contact was poor, and she had difficulty talking about anything other than her plastic horse collection. Within 15 minutes, she became more comfortable, revealing that she disliked school because the work was too hard. She thought that other children did not seem to like her because she was stupid and was not into clothes and dating. Sometimes they made fun of her and would start laughing whenever the teacher called on her. There were several peers who had similar interests in animals and seemed okay. She has been eating lunch with them but found it hard to relax and to believe that they really wanted to be friends. Daphne was always afraid of making mistakes, getting bad grades, and disappointing everyone. Often, she was so preoccupied with what to say or do next that she did not pay attention to her peers or teachers. She frequently was unable to make a decision for fear of not being right. Daphne was unable to identify any personal strengths or any aspect of her life that was going well. She wished she had more friends and that she was smarter. As long as she could remember, she had always felt this way. These difficulties made her sad, but she denied persistent depressive feelings or suicidal thoughts.

At that time, Ethan was a fourth grader at a private regular-education school for boys. The teacher told Ethan's parents that although Ethan had been among the best students in his class in the fall, his grades had slipped during the spring semester. He tended to get fidgety and distracted when the academic work became more challenging, and the teacher suggested the parents seek neuropsychiatric testing for him.At home, Ethan's mother explained, he seemed more emotional of late: \"He just looks weepy sometimes, which is unusual for him.\" She denied any difficulties at home, and she described her husband, son, 8-year-old daughter, and herself as a \"happy family.\" She had noticed, however, that Ethan seemed uneasy about being left alone. He hadbecome \"clingy,\" often following his parents around the house, and he hated being in any room by himself. Ethan had also started climbing into bed with his parents in the middle of the night, something he had never done in the past. Although Ethan had a few good friends in the neighborhood and at school and was glad to have other kids come to his house, he refused to go on sleepovers.Ethan's mother agreed that he appeared more fidgety. She had noticed that he often seemed to be shrugging his shoulders, grimacing, and blinking, which she took to be a sign of anxiety. These movements worsened when he was tired or frustrated, and they diminished in frequency during calm, focused activities such as clarinet practice or homework, especially when she was helping him.His mother also mentioned that Ethan had suddenly become \"superstitious.\" Whenever he stepped through a doorway, he would go back and forth until he touched both doorjambs with his hands simultaneously, twice in rapid succession. She hoped that Ethan's more conspicuous habits would subside by summer, when the family took its annual vacation. She felt that it was the right year for Disneyland, but Ethan's father had suggested taking him on a fishing trip (\"just the boys\") while mother and daughter visited relatives in New York City.Ethan's mother recalled her son as an \"easy child, but sensitive.\" He was the product of a planned, uncomplicated pregnancy and met all his developmental milestones on time.He had no history of medical problems or recent infections, but his mother mentioned that he had begun to make frequent visits to the school nurse's office complaining of stomachaches.On examination, Ethan was a slightly built boy with fair, freckly skin and blond hair. He was somewhat fidgety, tugging at his pants and shifting in his seat. Hearing his mother talk about his new movements seemed to provoke them, and the examiner noted that Ethan also occasionally blinked tightly, rolled his eyes, and made throat-clearing noises.

Penzner, M.D.https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9781615375295.jb02IntroductionJohn W. Barnhill, M.D.Schizophrenia is the prototypical psychotic disorder. Not only is it the most common psychosis, but schizophrenia tends to involve abnormalities in all five of the emphasized symptom domains: hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking (speech), grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (including catatonia), and negative symptoms. Like the DSM-5 neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia is viewed as a neuropsychiatric disorder with complex genetics and a clinical course that tends to begin during a predictable stage of development. Whereas the neurodevelopmental disorders tend to begin during childhood, symptoms of schizophrenia tend to develop during late adolescence and early adulthood.The schizophrenia diagnosis underwent some minor revisions in DSM-5. For example, because of their limited diagnostic stability, low reliability, and poor validity,schizophrenia subtypes were eliminated. These subtypes had included such categories as disorganized, paranoid, and residual types of schizophrenia.Long associated with schizophrenia, catatonia remains one of the potential diagnostic criteria for most of the psychotic diagnoses, including schizophrenia, but it can also be designated as a specifier for other psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medical conditions, including depressive and bipolar disorders. \"Other specified catatonia\" can also be diagnosed when criteria are either uncertain or incomplete for either the catatonia or the comorbid psychiatric or nonpsychiatric medical condition.The DSM-5 schizophrenia diagnosis continues to require persistence of two of five symptomatic criteria (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior or catatonia, and negative symptoms). One pertinent change in DSM-5 was the elimination of a special status for particular types of delusions and hallucinations, any one of which would previously have been adequate to fulfill symptomatic criteria for schizophrenia. A second change was the requirement for one of the two symptomatic criteria to be a positive symptom, such as delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized thinking.On the basis of recent research, DSM-5-TR has expanded its discussion of the impacts of stress and early life experience on the development of schizophrenia. For example, early trauma and neglect appear to be associated with both increased rates and increased severity of schizophrenia. Similarly, asylum seekers may have higher rates, as might members of ethnic minority groups when they live in areas with lower proportions of ethnic groups. Most often implicated in these rates of schizophrenia are various sorts of trauma, including discrimination, stigmatization, and reduced levels of social support.Criteria for schizoaffective disorder were tightened in DSM-5. As was the case in DSM- IV, a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that the patient meet criteria for schizophrenia and have symptoms of either major depressive or bipolar disorder concurrent with having active symptoms of schizophrenia. Also, as was the case previously, there must have been a 2-week period of delusions or hallucinations without prominent mood symptoms. The significant change in DSM-5 was that criteria for a major mood disorder must have been met for the majority of the total duration of theactive and residual phases of the overall illness. Therefore, the schizoaffective diagnosis requires more attention to the longitudinal course than was previously the case.Furthermore, the diagnostic requirement that major mood symptoms be present during most of the course of the psychotic disorder (including both the active and the residual phases) is expected to lead to a significant reduction in the number of people who meet criteria for schizoaffective disorder.Delusional disorder remains focused on the presence of delusions in the absence of other active symptoms of schizophrenia, depressive or bipolar disorders, and pertinent substance use. Bizarre delusions are now included as symptomatic criteria for delusional disorder, whereas delusions that are considered to be part of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) should not lead to a delusional disorder diagnosis but rather to a primary diagnosis of either BDD or OCD, along with the \"absent insight/delusional beliefs\" specifier.Brief psychotic disorder and schizophreniform disorder remained essentially unchanged in DSM-5. They are distinguished from schizophrenia primarily on the basis of the duration of symptoms, with brief psychotic episode referring to people who have symptoms for less than 1 month, and schizophreniform referring to people who have symptoms lasting 1-6 months. DSM-5-TR does discuss evidence indicating that brief psychotic episode often has a favorable prognosis, despite relapse rates that may be higher than 50%. Similarly, although most people with a provisional schizophreniform diagnosis go on to receive a schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder diagnosis, one- third appear to recover within that 6-month window.Not specifically discussed in this text are cases that involve atypical or incomplete presentations or situations such as the emergency room setting, where information is often incomplete. Within DSM-5, these diagnostic categories are referred to as \"other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder,\" \"unspecified catatonia,\" and \"unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.\"The \"other specified\" and \"unspecified\" categories reflect the reality that humans' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors lie on a continuum, as do their disorders, and are provided as diagnostic options throughout much of DSM-5. These diagnostic gray zonesare especially pertinent in regard to schizophrenia spectrum illness. For many people who end up with a chronic illness such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, there exists a period of time in which they begin to show symptoms but are not yet diagnosed. It had been proposed that this issue be addressed in DSM-5 by creating a new diagnosis, attenuated psychosis syndrome. Psychiatrists are not yet able to robustly predict which patients are most likely to go on to develop full-blown psychotic symptoms, but accurate prediction is important enough that the syndrome is mentioned in two places. First, attenuated psychosis syndrome can be used as a specifier within this chapter of DSM-5, where it would be listed as \"other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (attenuated psychosis syndrome).\" The condition is also discussed in more detail in the \"Conditions for Further Study\" chapter in DSM-5 Section III.Suggested ReadingsBailey T, Alvarez-Jimenez M, Garcia-Sanchez AM, et al: Childhood trauma is associated with severity of hallucinations and delusions in psychotic disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Because she appeared tobe an \"emotionally disturbed person,\" a psychiatry consultation was requested.According to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen's who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.On examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, \"Sorry, sorry.\" She did not respond to other questions.More information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen's first bus ride without a staff member.According to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of \"childhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.\" She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to \"have my own room in my own house with my own friends.\" The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated.The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.Ms. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Schizophrenia, multiple episodes, currently in acute episode\n\nSuggested ReadingsHeckers S, Barch DM, Bustillo J, et al: Structure of the psychotic disorders classification in DSM 5.

He quit seeing his friends and spent most of his time lying in bed staring at the ceiling. He lived with several family members but rarely spoke to any of them. He had been suspended from college because of lack of attendance. His sister said that she had recurrently seen him mumbling quietly to himself and noted that he would sometimes, at night, stand on the roof of their home and wave his arms as if he were \"conducting a symphony.\" He denied having anyintention of jumping from the roof or having any thoughts of self-harm, but claimed that he felt liberated and in tune with the music when he was on the roof. Although his father and sister had tried to encourage him to see someone at the university's student health clinic, Mr. Baker had never seen a psychiatrist and had no prior hospitalizations.During the prior several months, Mr. Baker had become increasingly preoccupied with a female friend, Anne, who lived down the street. While he insisted to his family that they were engaged, Anne told Mr. Baker's sister that they had hardly ever spoken and certainly were not dating. Mr. Baker's sister also reported that he had written many letters to Anne but never mailed them; instead, they just accumulated on his desk.His family said that they had never known him to use illicit substances or alcohol, and his toxicology screen was negative. When asked about drug use, Mr. Baker appeared angry and did not answer.On examination in the ER, Mr. Baker was a well-groomed young man who was generally uncooperative. He appeared constricted, guarded, inattentive, and preoccupied. He became enraged when the ER staff brought him dinner. He loudly insisted that all of the hospital's food was poisoned and that he would only drink a specific type of bottled water. He was noted to have paranoid, grandiose, and romantic delusions. He appeared to be internally preoccupied, although he denied hallucinations. Mr. Baker reported feeling \"bad\" but denied depression and did not show disturbances in his sleep or appetite.

Onexamination, he was a tall, slim, and well-groomed young man with glasses. He spoke softly, with an increased latency of speech. His affect was blunted except when he became anxious while discussing his symptoms.Mr. Coleman stated that he had come to the ER at his sister's suggestion. He said he could use a \"general checkup\" because of several days of \"migraines\" and \"hallucinations of a spiritual nature\" that had persisted for 3 months. His headache involved \"sharp, shooting\" sensations in various bilateral locations in his head and a \"ringing\" sensation along the midline of his brain that seemed to worsen when he thought about his vices.Mr. Coleman described his vices as being \"alcohol, cigarettes, disrespecting my parents, girls.\" He denied guilt, anxiety, or preoccupation with any of his military duties during his tour in Iraq, although his sister shared that Hakim's military responsibilities were of a confidential nature. He had joined an evangelical church 4 months earlier in the context of being \"riddled with guilt\" about \"all the things I've done.\" Three months earlier, he began \"hearing voices trying to make me feel guilty\" most days. The last auditory hallucination had been the day before. During these past few months, he became withdrawn and noticed that strangers were commenting on his past sins.Mr. Coleman believed that his migraines and guilt might be due to alcohol withdrawal. He had been drinking three or four cans of beer most days of the week for several years until he \"quit\" 4 months earlier after joining the church. He still drank \"a beer or two\" every other week but felt guilty afterward. He denied alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as tremor and sweats. He had smoked cannabis up to twice monthly for years but completely quit when he joined the church. He denied using other illicit drugs except for one uneventful use of cocaine 3 years earlier. He sometimes would sleep only a few hours and did report some nightmares. Otherwise, Mr. Coleman denied depressive, manic, or psychotic symptoms and violent ideation.Regarding PTSD, Mr. Coleman's score on the 20-item self-administered PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was below the cutoff score (between 31 and 33 out of 80) that would indicate probable PTSD in veterans.

His sister believed that Mr. Coleman had been \"brainwashed\" by the church. His girlfriend, however, had attended services with Mr. Coleman. She reported that several members of the congregation had told her they had occasionally talked to new members who felt guilt over their prior behaviors, but none who had ever hallucinated, and they were worried about him.A physical examination of the patient, including a neurological screen, was unremarkable, as were routine laboratory testing, a blood alcohol level, and urine toxicology.

He said that his problems began 3 months earlier, after he returned from a visit to Japan. He said his first indication of trouble was when a classmate sneezed and grinned at him in an odd way. Later that same week, he noticed two strangers lurking suspiciously outside his apartment.Mr. Daishi decided that those lurking strangers had installed tiny mind-control devices throughout his apartment, devices that were intended to weaken his resolve and prepare him for an onslaught of misinformation from Fox News reporters who intended to convert him into being a follower of Donald Trump. After weakening his resolve, Mr.Daishi found himself only able to watch Fox News, and he then found that those television reporters began to relentlessly comment indirectly and critically about him. He soon came to the conclusion that they had targeted him because of his \"superior intelligence\" and because he would soon become the prime minister of Japan. He concluded that the Trump Republicans wanted an ally in Tokyo. Mr. Daishi indicated that he was trying to stay strong, but it was difficult to keep the reporters from putting ideas into his head.Mr. Daishi reported that he became increasingly vigilant, fearing that everyone at school and in his apartment complex was \"in on the plot.\" He slept little, became withdrawn, and stopped attending classes, but he did continue to eat and maintain his personal hygiene.He denied feeling elated or euphoric.

At about the same time, Mr. Evans began to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana every day. In addition, he developed recurrent panic attacks, marked by a sudden onset of palpitations, diaphoresis, and thoughts that he was going to die. When he was at his most depressed and panicky, he twice received a combination of sertraline 100 mg/day and psychotherapy. In both cases, his most intense depressive symptoms lifted within a few weeks, and he discontinued the sertraline after a few months. Between episodes of severe depression, he was generally seen as sad, irritable, and amotivated. His school performance declined around tenth grade and remained marginal throughout the rest of high school. He did not attend college as his parents had expected him to, but instead lived at home and did odd jobs in the neighborhood.Around age 20, Mr. Evans developed a psychotic episode in which he had the conviction that he had murdered people when he was 6 years old. Although he could not remember who these people were or the circumstances, he was absolutely convinced that this had happened, something that was confirmed by continuous voices accusing him of being a murderer. He also became convinced that other people would punish him for what had happened, and thus he feared for his life. Over the ensuing few weeks, he became guilt- ridden and preoccupied with the idea that he should kill himself by slashing his wrists, which culminated in his being psychiatrically hospitalized.Although he was predominantly anxious on admission, Mr. Evans soon became very depressed, with prominent anhedonia, poor sleep, and decreased appetite and concentration. With the combined use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications, both the depression and the psychotic symptoms remitted after 4 weeks. Therefore, the total duration of the psychotic episode was approximately 7 weeks, 4 of which were also characterized by major depressive disorder. Mr. Evans had been hospitalized with the same pattern of symptoms two additional times before age 22, and each of these episodes started with several weeks of delusions and hallucinations related to his conviction that he had murdered someone when he was a child, followed by severe depression lasting an additional month. Both relapses occurred while he was apparently adherent to reasonable dosages of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. During the 3 years prior to this evaluation, Mr. Evans had been adherent to clozapine and had been without hallucinations and delusions. He had also been adherent to his antidepressant medication and supportive psychotherapy, although his dysphoria, irritability, and amotivation never completely resolved.Mr. Evans's history was significant for marijuana and alcohol misuse that began at age15. Before the onset of psychosis at age 20, he smoked several joints of marijuana almost daily and binge-drank on weekends, with occasional blackouts. After the onset of the psychosis, he decreased his marijuana and alcohol use significantly, with two several- month-long periods of abstinence, yet he continued to have psychotic episodes up through age 22. He started attending Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous groups, achieved sobriety from marijuana and alcohol at age 23, and had remained sober for the 2 years prior to this evaluation.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nSchizoaffective disorder, depressive type\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nAlcohol use disorder, in remission\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nCannabis use disorder, in remission\n\nSuggested ReadingHeckers S: Diagnostic criteria for schizoaffective disorder.

To commemorate the event, they decided to get tattoos. Afterward, they went to a nearby park, where Mr. Foster bought and smoked a marijuana cigarette. During the ensuing hour, Mr. Foster began to believe that the symbols in his tattoo had mysterious meaning and power. He became convinced that the tattoo artist was conspiring with others against him and that his wife was cheating on him. After returning to the hotel, the patient searched his wife's phone for evidence of her infidelity and threatened to jump out the window. The patient's wife, an ER physician, successfully convinced the patient to go to sleep, thinking that the episode would resolve.The following day, the patient remained paranoid and delusional. He again threatened to jump out the window, and indicated that he would have no choice but to kill his wife the next time she slept.

Later that day, he was admitted to an acute inpatient psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of unspecified psychotic disorder.Mr. Foster had smoked cannabis sporadically from age 18 but began to smoke daily 5 years prior to this admission. In the past year, his cannabis use had steadily increased;previously he had been smoking once per day, but more recently his use had increased to three times a day, beginning when he awoke. He noted that he has begun to feel \"anxious\" when not under the influence of cannabis and believed his thrice-daily use helped him \"even out.\" The patient and his wife denied that he had ever used other illicit substances, and the patient indicated that he rarely drank alcohol.

When no corroborating evidence was found on skin examination and the patient insisted that she was unsafe at home, she was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric service with \"unspecified psychotic disorder.\"Her concerns began around 1 week prior to presentation. To contend with financial stress, she had taken in temporary renters for a spare room in her home and had begun pet sitting for some neighbors. Under these conditions, she perceived tiny insects burrowing into her skin and walls and covering her rugs and mattress. She had spent the 36 hours prior to presentation frantically cleaning her home, fearing that her tenants would not pay if they saw the fleas. She showered repeatedly, using shampoos meant to treat animal infestations, and she consulted three different exterminators, although nonefound evidence of fleas. She threw away a bag of clothing, believing she heard fleas \"rustling and scratching inside.\" She bought replacement clothes that she kept in their own trash bag, thereby spending almost all of her savings, which worsened her preexisting financial strain.Aside from her concerns about infestation, Ms. Gonzalez denied symptoms of depression, mania, and suspiciousness. She denied using any drugs or alcohol. No one in her family had a history of psychiatric illness. Ms. Gonzalez had been diagnosed with depression in college and briefly treated with an antidepressant. She had no relevant medical problems.Her worries about infestation began in the setting of her sister's diagnosis with invasive cancer, the onset of her own menopause, financial strain that was likely forcing her to move from the United States back to Argentina (her country of origin), and a recent breakup with her boyfriend. At baseline, she described herself as an obsessive person who had always had \"contamination phobias\" that historically worsened during times of anxiety.On mental status examination, Ms. Gonzalez was calm and easily engaged, with normal relatedness and eye contact.

Herpreoccupation improved within days and resolved entirely within 2 weeks. She developed enough insight to refer to her belief that fleas were in her skin as a \"crazy thought.\" She attributed her \"break from reality\" to multiple stressors, and was able to articulate that she relied on her delusion as a way to distract herself from real problems.

Swartz, M.D.https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9781615375295.jb03IntroductionJohn W. Barnhill, M.D.Bipolar disorders feature a distinct period of mania or hypomania. For example, a patient might develop a relatively acute onset of euphoria, diminished need for sleep, grandiosity, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and a variety of behavioral indiscretions. Absent complicating factors, such a patient would likely be readily identified as having a manic episode as part of bipolar I disorder.Complicating factors abound in diagnosing bipolar and related disorders, however, which is one reason that this chapter features an abundance of cases. Most of the complications relate to symptom evaluation. DSM-5 identified seven symptoms that tend to cluster in bipolar I disorder, and the diagnosis of mania requires three of these symptoms. Each of the symptoms requires clinical judgment in regard to both duration and intensity, and certain problems, such as \"distractibility\" and \"reduced need for sleep,\" are not always obvious during a clinical evaluation. A diagnosis of mania requiresthat symptoms from this cluster persist for most of the day, every day, for at least a week. This standard requires an accurate history, which can be difficult to obtain from any patient, but particularly from a patient who may have little insight into the presence of a psychiatric problem (as is often the case for individuals with bipolar disorder). An accurate bipolar history is even more difficult to obtain when the presenting symptom is depression, and manic symptoms might not have been present for many years. Half of patients with bipolar disorder use illicit substances, which can complicate the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. Depression is so commonly found in bipolar disorder that the disorder was previously called \"manic depression.\" The relationship between the two mood states is not always clear, however, which is one reason that bipolar and related disorders were shifted into a separate chapter in DSM-5. As it turns out, depression can be absent in bipolar disorder, but it can also be the dominant mood state in regard to both frequency and intensity of symptoms. Mood can oscillate between the two poles of depression and mania, or the two can coexist (e.g., a mood episode with mixed features). The relationship between the depressive and manic symptoms is made even more complicated by the reality that patients are more likely to spontaneously complain about dysphoria than about euphoria.Finally, as is generally the case for disorders throughout DSM-5, a bipolar diagnosis requires impairment. Some of the core symptoms of mania-increased activity, euphoria, and talkativeness-can lead to increased effectiveness and pleasure, at least in the short term, which further complicates the assessment.DSM-5 addressed these uncertainties by describing multiple syndromes within the bipolar spectrum. For example, diagnoses of mania and hypomania both require \"three of seven listed criteria, most of the day, nearly every day.\" However, mania requires at least one episode lasting at least 7 days, whereas hypomania requires only a 4-day duration. Instead of requiring a marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, as specified for mania, hypomania requires an unequivocal change from baseline that is observable by others. These criteria take into consideration the reality that manic and hypomanic patients often lack insight, and the criteria emphasize that hypomania is less severe than mania. Hypomania is a key feature of DSM-5 bipolar II disorder. A second distinguishing feature of bipolar II disorder is the requirement for at least one major depressive episode at a time when hypomanic symptoms are not present.This requirement is in contrast to bipolar I disorder, which does not require the historical presence of depression.Other patients may have classic manic or hypomanic symptoms but with an apparent physiological precipitant. For example, a patient may have developed manic symptoms immediately after receiving prednisone, a steroid, for a flare-up of systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus). In this case, the clinician might conclude that the patient has bipolar disorder, which would presumably warrant a mood-stabilizing medication.Alternatively, the patient may have had a fairly common reaction to steroids and warrant a diagnosis of medication-induced bipolar disorder (a disorder commonly and inaccurately labeled \"steroid psychosis\"); if so, a likely treatment would be reduction of the steroid medication. The patient's symptoms may, however, be best conceptualized as neuropsychiatric lupus, which in DSM-5 would be called bipolar disorder due to another medical condition. In that case, however, the patient might be best treated by an increase in steroids. One reason that the bipolar diagnosis is so hotly contested is that making the correct diagnosis is vitally important for patient care.The bipolar spectrum also includes clusters of individuals whose mania-related symptoms are significant but who do not meet criteria for bipolar I or II disorder by virtue of the number or duration of symptoms. For example, some patients have a chronic course of alternating hypomanic and subthreshold depressive symptoms. To reach the diagnostic threshold for DSM-5 cyclothymic disorder, these symptoms need to be distressing and persistent (more days than not for at least 2 years-1 year in adolescents-with no more than 2 months without symptoms), and the individual should never have met criteria for a manic episode or a major depressive episode. DSM-5 cyclothymic disorder is quite parallel to DSM-5 persistent depressive disorder in regard to both duration and intensity of symptoms.Other patients have significant manic symptoms, but an adequate history is not elicited because of the situation (e.g., an emergency room visit); in such cases, the diagnosis would be unspecified bipolar and related disorder. A variety of other patients are diagnosed with other specified bipolar and related disorder. These include people whose manic symptoms either persist for an inadequate duration (e.g., only 2-3 days rather than the required 4 days) or persist for greater than 4 days but do not meet the three ofseven symptomatic criteria for hypomania. Still others meet criteria for hypomania but lack a history of major depressive disorder and therefore do not meet criteria for bipolar II disorder. Others have chronic hypomania and subthreshold depressive symptoms but do not meet the 24-month criterion for cyclothymia.Bipolar spectrum diagnoses have generated significant controversy. One issue relates to duration. It is difficult to make a diagnosis in which the symptoms need be present for only a few days and do not necessarily cause significant distress. Another complication relates to symptom intensity. Distinguishing normal from abnormal is not always easy when the variables include such core human behaviors as talkativeness, risk taking, need for sleep, and self-esteem.To address this controversy, DSM-5 balances two competing interests. The first is to identify robust, discrete symptom clusters that occur within distressed patients.Accurate diagnosis is crucial for a cluster of disorders that cause significant dysfunction and distress and are accompanied by a lifetime risk of suicide that is more than 20 times that in the general population. The second competing interest is to avoid pathologizing normal human experience. Absent reliable tests for \"bipolar disorder,\" the onus is on the clinician to make use of these criteria and to follow available evidence in both the diagnosis and treatment of these challenging patients.Suggested ReadingsCosgrove VE, Suppes T: Informing DSM-5: biological boundaries between bipolar I disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia.

The referral form indicated that the man was \"schizophrenic\" and an \"emotionally disturbed person.\" One of the police officers said that the man offered to pay them for sex while in the back seat of their patrol car. He referred to himself as the \"New Jesus\" and declined to offer another name. He refused to sit and instead ran through the ER. He was put into restraints and received intramuscularly administered lorazepam 2 mg and haloperidol 5 mg. Intravenous diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50 mg was readied in case of extrapyramidal side effects.The admitting team wrote that he had \"unspecified psychosis\" and transferred him to the psychiatry team that worked in the ER.Despite being restrained, the patient remained giddily agitated, talking about receiving messages from God. When asked when he had last slept, he said he no longer needed sleep, indicating that he had \"been touched by Heaven.\" His speech was rapid, disorganized, and difficult to understand. A complete blood count, blood chemistries, and a toxicology screen were drawn. After an additional 45 minutes of agitation, he received another dose of lorazepam. This calmed him, but he still did not sleep. The restraints were removed.An hour after receiving the initial haloperidol and lorazepam, the patient was interviewed while he sat in a chair in the ER. He was an overweight African American man who was disheveled and malodorous. He did not smell of alcohol. He made poor eye contact, instead looking at nearby people, a ticking clock, the examiner, a nearby nurse- at anything or anyone that moved. His speech was disorganized, rapid, and hard to follow. His leg bounced rapidly up and down, but he did not get out of his chair or threaten the interviewer. He described his mood as \"not bad.\" His affect was labile. He often laughed for no particular reason but would get angrily frustrated when he felt misunderstood. His thought process was disorganized. He had grandiose delusions, and his perceptions were significant for \"God talking to me.\" He denied other hallucinations and denied suicidal and homicidal ideation. When asked the date, he responded with an extended discussion about the underlying meaning of the day's date, which he missed by a single day. He remembered the names of the two police officers who had brought him to the hospital. He refused more cognitive testing. His insight and judgment appearedpoor.The patient's sister arrived an hour later, after having been called by a neighbor who had seen her brother, Mark Hill, being taken away in a police car. The sister said that her brother had seemed strange a week earlier, uncharacteristically arguing with relatives at a holiday gathering. He had claimed not to need sleep at that time and had been talking about his \"gifts.\" She had tried to contact Mr. Hill since then, but he had not responded to phone, e-mail, or text messages. She said he did not like to talk about his issues, but she had twice seen a bottle of olanzapine in his house. She knew their father had been called \"schizophrenic\" and \"bipolar,\" but she had not seen her father since she was a child. She said that Mr. Hill did not typically use drugs. She also said he was 34 years old and a middle school math teacher who had just finished a semester of teaching.A review of Mr. Hill's electronic medical record indicated that he had experienced a similar episode 2 years earlier. At that time, a toxicology screen had been negative. He had been hospitalized for 2 weeks on the inpatient psychiatric service and was given a discharge diagnosis of \"schizoaffective disorder\"; he also was prescribed olanzapine and referred to an outpatient clinic for follow-up. The chart had additionally referred to two previous admissions to the county inpatient hospital, but records from that hospital were not available after hours.Over the next 24 hours, Mr. Hill calmed significantly. He continued to believe that he was being misunderstood and that he did not need to be hospitalized. When asked, he agreed that he had a direct connection to God and \"an important role on Earth,\" but he denied having a connection to anyone called the \"New Jesus.\" His speech remained rapid and loud. The interviewer noted that he seemed easier to redirect, though his thoughts continued to jump from idea to idea. He remained tense and jumpy but denied paranoia or fear.Serial physical examinations revealed no abnormalities aside from blisters on his feet. The patient was not tremulous, and his deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical and graded 2 of 4. He showed no neurological asymmetry. His toxicology screen was negative and his blood alcohol level was zero. His initial lab results were pertinent for elevated blood urea nitrogen and a blood sugar level of 210 mg/dL. His mean corpuscularvolume, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, and magnesium levels were normal. His BMI was 30.8.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nBipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with mood-congruent psychotic features\n\nSuggested ReadingsGara MA, Vega WA, Arndt S, et al: Influence of patient race and ethnicity on clinical assessment in patients with affective disorders.

He noted that these \"dark periods\" had gone on as long as he had known her but that she had experienced at least a half dozen of these episodes in the prior year. He said they typically improved within a few weeks of restarting her fluoxetine. He added that he wondered whether alcohol and clonazepam worsened her symptoms, because she routinely ramped up their use when the dark periods began.Ms. Ingram's husband said he had decided to bring her to the ER after he discoveredthat she had recently created a blog entitled Nancy Ingram's Best Stock Picks. Such an activity not only was out of character but also, given her job as a stock analyst for a large investment bank, was strictly against company policy. He said that she had been working on these stock picks around the clock, forgoing her own meals as well as her responsibilities at work and with her children. She countered that she was fine and that her blog would \"make them as rich as Croesus.\"The patient had first been diagnosed with depression in college, after the death of her father from suicide. He had been a wildly erratic, alcohol-abusing businessman whom the patient loved very much. Her paternal grandmother had several \"nervous breakdowns,\" but her diagnosis and treatment history were unknown. Since college, her mood had generally been \"down,\" interspersed with recurrent bouts of worsened dysphoria, insomnia, and uncharacteristically rapid speech and hyperalertness. She had tried psychotherapy sporadically and taken a series of antidepressant medications, but her husband noted that the baseline depression persisted and that the dark periods were increasing in frequency.Her outpatient psychiatrist noted that Ms. Ingram appeared to have dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) and recurrent major depressive disorder. He also said that he had never seen her during her periods of edginess and insomnia-she always refused to see him until the \"really down\" periods improved-and that she had refused him access to her husband or to any other source of collateral information.On examination, the patient was pacing angrily in the exam room. She was dressed in jeans and a shirt that was carelessly unbuttoned. Her eyes appeared glazed and unfocused. She responded to the examiner's entrance by sitting down and explaining that this was all a miscommunication, that she was fine and needed to get home immediately to tend to her business. Her speech was rapid, pressured, and very difficult to interrupt. She admitted to not sleeping but denied that it was a problem. She denied hallucinations but admitted, with a smile, to a unique ability to predict the stock market.

Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.Ms. Jacobs's psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both ofthese substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.Around age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home.These depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs's moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.Upon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform. She stated that she thought about suicide most of the time and that she had found nothing to distract her. She denied recent drinking or smoking marijuana, stating she did not feel like \"partying.\" She acknowledged profound feelings of emptiness and indicated that she had occasionally cut her arms superficially to \"see what it would feel like.\" She stated that she knew that cutting herself in this way would not kill her. She reported depersonalization and occasional panic attacks.

Most recently, she described depressed mood during the month since she began a new job. She said she was preoccupied with concerns that her new boss and colleagues thought her work was inadequate and slow and that she was unfriendly. She had no energy and enthusiasm at home, either, and instead of playing with her children or talking to her husband, she tended to watch television for hours, overeat, and sleep excessively. This had led to a 6- pound weight gain in just 3 weeks, which made her feel even worse about herself. She had begun to cry several times a week, which she reported as the sign that she \"knew the depression had returned.\" She had also begun to think often of death, although she had never attempted suicide.Ms. Kershaw said her memory about her history of depressions was a little fuzzy, so she brought in her husband, who had known her since college. They agreed that she had first become depressed in her teens and that she had experienced at least five discrete periods of depression as an adult. These episodes generally included depressed mood, anergia, amotivation, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, deep feelings of guilt, decreased libido, and mild to moderate suicidal ideation without plan. Her depressions were often punctuatedby periods of \"too much\" energy, irritability, pressured speech, and flight of ideas. These episodes of excess energy could last hours, days, or a couple of weeks. The depressed mood would not lift during these periods, but she would \"at least be able to do a few things.\"When specifically asked, Ms. Kershaw's husband described distinctive times when Ms. Kershaw seemed unusually excited, happy, and self-confident, and like a \"different person.\" She would talk fast, seem energized and optimistic, do the daily chores very efficiently, and start (and often finish) new projects. She would need little sleep and still be enthusiastic the next day. Ms. Kershaw recalled these periods but said they felt \"normal.\" In response to a question about hypersexuality, Ms. Kershaw smiled for the only time during the interview, saying that although her husband seemed to be including her good periods as part of her illness, he had not been complaining when she had her longest such episode (about 6 days) when they first started dating in college. Since then, she reported that these episodes were \"fairly frequent\" and lasted 2 or 3 days.Because of her periodic low mood and thoughts of death, she had seen various psychiatrists since her mid-teenage years. Psychotherapy tended to work \"okay\" until she had another depressive episode, when she would be unable to attend sessions and would then just quit. Three antidepressant trials of adequate dosage and duration(6 months to 3 years) were each associated with short-term relief of depression, followed by relapse. Both alone and in the presence of her husband, Ms. Kershaw denied any history of alcohol or substance misuse. A maternal aunt and maternal grandfather had been recurrently hospitalized for mania, although Ms. Kershaw was quick to point out that she was \"not at all like them.\"On examination, Ms. Kershaw was a well-groomed, overweight woman who often averted her eyes and tended to speak very softly. No abnormal motor movements were noted, but her movements were constrained, and she did not use hand gestures. Her mood was depressed. Her affect was sad and constricted. Her thought processes were fluid, though possibly slowed. Her thought content was notable for depressive content, including passive suicidal ideation without evidence of paranoia, hallucinations, or delusions.

After behavioral interventions were ineffective, the patient began treatment with a methylphenidate-based medication at age 8.Improvement was seen at school, in her social life, and at home. For the ensuing 6 years, Rachel had done well and was \"pretty much like other kids as long as she took her medicine.\"At around age 14, however, Rachel became \"moody.\" Instead of being a \"bubbly teenager,\" she would spend days by herself and hardly speak to anyone. During these periods of persistent sadness, she would sleep more than usual, complain that her friends didn't like her anymore, and not seem interested in anything.

She would \"laugh at anything\" and would enthusiastically help out with and even initiate household chores. Because these were the \"good phases,\" the mother did not think these episodes were noteworthy.Rachel had no general medical problems.

I can stop my antivirals!\"While Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately 1 month earlier. At that point, he began an unusually intense editing project. After about 10 days of little sleep, \"boundless energy,\" and activity, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and \"glassy-eyed.\" That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project.

Acutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank three martinis but still did not sleep that night.

That episode was punctuated by a purposeful overdose and a 2-week psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Mr.Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him \"hyper and edgy,\" and he stopped the psychotherapy because \"it was pointless.\" He used methamphetamine frequently for several years, which led to recurrent unprotected intercourse with strangers.Mr. Lopez was diagnosed with HIV at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient substance use disorder rehabilitation center and discontinued his use of stimulants and alcohol. His lowest CD4 lymphocyte count had been 216 cells/mm3, when he was age 24, at which time his viral load was 1.6 million copies. He had been reportedly adherent to his antiretroviral medications since then. His most recent CD4 count, 6 months prior to this episode, had been 526 cells/mm3. His viral load had been undetectable. He had suffered fatigue but had not had any AIDS-defining illnesses. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy and periventricular white matter disease in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had \"lost a step\" cognitively over the past year.His family psychiatric history was significant for a maternal aunt who had received lithium and several courses of electroconvulsive therapy, but her diagnosis was unknown.On examination, the patient was a sloppily dressed young man who told a pressured, disjointed story of events over the prior month.

Mr.Mustafa's friends reported that he had recently undergone treatment for testicular cancer, but that he had been in a good mood when they had last seen him 4 nights earlier. He had not shown up for a planned get-together the following day and had then not responded to e-mails, texts, or phone calls. They had not known how to contact his parents or relatives and had no other history.In the ER, Mr. Mustafa related to others in an odd manner, standing stiffly and not making eye contact or answering questions. After about 10 minutes, he suddenly grabbed a staff member by the arm. While he seemed to lack a purpose or intent to harm, he refused to let go, and the staff member was unable to extricate herself until a security guard intervened. At that point, he received intramuscular haloperidol and lorazepam. During the ensuing hour, his extremities became rigid, and while lying on a hospital bed, he held his arms above his head, with his elbows bent. He was admitted to the medical service. A head computed tomography (CT) scan, routine laboratory tests, and urine toxicology were noncontributory, except that his creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was elevated, at 906 IU/L. His heart rate was also elevated, at 110 beats per minute. He had no fever, and his blood pressure was within the normal range.On examination, Mr. Mustafa was found to be a thin young man lying in bed, with his head held awkwardly off the pillow. He was stiffly raising his arms up and down. His hair was falling out in tufts. He stared straight ahead with infrequent blinks, making no eye contact. He was not diaphoretic and did not appear to be in pain. Physical examination revealed an initial resistance against any movement of his arms. When either arm was moved into a position by the examiner, it remained in that position. No myoclonus was evident. Speaking with a long latency and significantly decreased production, he expressed fear that he was dying. As he slowly expressed his anxiety, his body remainedstiff and rigid. He denied auditory or visual hallucinations. He was fully awake and alert and was oriented to time and place but did not participate in other cognitive tests.Mr. Mustafa was clinically unchanged for 3 days while he received intravenous fluids. No psychoactive medication was given. Laboratory tests, an electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were unrevealing, and his CPK trended downward after peaking at 1,100 IU/L. On the fourth hospital day, Mr. Mustafa was given a test dose of intravenous lorazepam 1 mg and then a repeat dose of 1 mg after 5 minutes. He did not become sedated. His mental status did not change, except that his speech was slightly more productive after the second dose. Intravenous lorazepam 1 mg every 4-6 hours was started. After 24 hours, his rigidity had resolved, his speech was fluent and pressured, and he became very active and agitated. He paced the hallways, followed the nurses around, and tried to leave the hospital. He told staff, other patients, and visitors that he was a great artist and that he had cured his cancer. His CPK normalized and tachycardia resolved. He remained afebrile.Mr. Mustafa's parents arrived from out of town on the sixth hospital day. They reported that his only previous psychiatric history had been a depression that developed when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer 1 year earlier. Mr. Mustafa had been taking sertraline 50 mg/day and was doing well until 10 days prior to admission, when he learned that he had a recurrence of testicular cancer with metastasis to the retroperitoneum. He immediately underwent chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and dexamethasone.

On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.Ms. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s. These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.Ms. Norman's own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child. This episode was not talked about in the family, and there were few other details. She had no other family history of note.Until just before delivery of her child, Ms. Norman had been a highly functional nurse in a renal unit.

Ms. Owens arrived at the appointment well dressed and a little agitated. Speaking at a normal pace, she explained that her depressive symptoms had begun 2 years earlier in the setting of initiating divorce proceedings from her fourth husband. She described poor mood, incapacitating worry about her future, and poor concentration. These symptoms progressed to anhedonia, decreased energy, hypersomnia with interrupted sleep, passive suicidal ideation, and increased appetite with carbohydrate craving. She stopped going to work as an event planner and began spending most of the day in bed.Ms. Owens initially sought treatment from a homeopath, who prescribed a variety of remedies that were not helpful. She eventually saw her internist, who prescribed alprazolam 0.25 mg three times a day as needed. This medication reduced her worry but had little effect on her mood. Her internist then initiated sertraline 50 mg/day, increasing the dosage (as tolerated) to 200 mg/day. Over the ensuing 2 months, Ms.Owens's sleep improved and she no longer experienced suicidal thoughts. However, she became more anxious, irritable, agitated, and energized and noted that her thoughts moved rapidly. She denied impulsivity and psychotic symptoms.Ms. Owens had a long-standing history of similar depressive episodes. The first such episode occurred during college, lasted for several months, and was untreated.When specifically asked, she described multiple periods in her life when she had moderately elevated mood, rapid thoughts, and increased energy. It seemed that many important life accomplishments occurred during these periods. For instance, as a young, recently divorced unemployed single mother, she agreed to throw a bridal shower for her best friend. She pored over bridal and craft magazines, determined to create a fabulous party on a shoestring budget. She became totally engrossed in the project, seeming to have abundant energy and ideas. The shower was a huge success and launched Ms.Owens's career as a party planner. She hid her mood swings from her clients and colleagues, leveraging her elevated mood states to project a high-energy \"face,\" but then would retreat and avoid work when her mood became low. She also became more irritable during these high-energy episodes, and she believed that each of her marriages both began and ended because of her tendency to \"get emotional\" when she was in these elevated mood states. Although these periods could last for many weeks, she did not experience changes in sleep, engage in risky behaviors, speak quickly, or become grandiose, and she saw nothing problematic about them.Ms. Owens also reported that she drank heavily when she was in her 40s but rarely did so now.

Barnhill, M.D.Depression is one of the most commonly used words in psychiatry, and it is also one of the most ambiguous. As a symptom it can mean sadness, but as a diagnosis it can be applied to people who deny feeling sad. Depressed mood is a common, normal human experience, but it can also reflect a seriously debilitating, distressing, and potentially fatal condition. Depression can present in multiple ways, with many potential comorbidities, precipitants, and reliably associated symptoms.It is important to recognize that depressive symptoms can be found in almost all disorders in DSM-5, and a chief complaint of \"sadness\" is only the beginning of the diagnostic inquiry. It is also useful to recall that essentially all of the major nonmood disorders in DSM-5 increase the likelihood of comorbid major depressive disorder. For example, although bipolar disorder has historically been viewed as \"manic depression,\" and therefore as a subset of depression, it has become increasingly clear that whilebipolar and depressive disorders have similarities, they also have substantive differences in regard to clinical presentation, family history, longitudinal course, and treatment. For these reasons, bipolar disorder was moved into its own chapter in DSM-5. The overlap persists, however, and the depressive and bipolar disorder chapters go into detail in an effort to distinguish the sometimes subtle differences between these diagnoses.Major depressive disorder (MDD) remains the archetypal depressive disorder, and its diagnostic criteria are essentially unchanged in DSM-5. The diagnosis still hinges on the assessment of clinical presentation (presence of five of nine symptoms), history (persistence for longer than 2 weeks), and relevance (significant distress or impairment). To further subdivide this broad category, DSM-5 provides specifiers that distinguish the episode based on severity and recurrence as well as the presence of such factors as melancholia, psychotic features, and catatonia. A particularly useful change from DSM- IV is the delinkage of psychosis and severity, so the clinician can accurately describe people whose depressive symptoms are, say, moderate, but who have an associated psychosis.The text within DSM-5-TR includes many different assessment tips. For example, many people with depression report insomnia or fatigue rather than depression per se, and a failure to look for depressive symptoms can lead to underdiagnosis. Psychomotor disturbance and guilt (whether delusional or near-delusional) are much less common in MDD than insomnia or fatigue but tend to be markers for greater severity.Culture can affect the diagnosis of depression in multiple ways. Poverty, racism, and marginalization are examples of structural adversities that may contribute to the development of MDD. The prevalence, course, and symptomatology of depression vary among different cultures, but a depressive syndrome has been widely identified across cultures. Although such symptoms are not included in the official criteria, DSM-5-TR suggests being alert to depressive manifestations such as social isolation, anger, tearfulness, and diffuse pain. Somatic complaints are typical presenting complaints of depression in many cultures, and it can be helpful to tactfully explore the meaning of these symptoms as they relate to local social contexts.Studies consistently indicate that women are significantly more likely than men todevelop MDD. It has been hypothesized that these elevated rates are partly related to women's disproportionate exposure to interpersonal trauma over the life span. In addition, women may be at elevated risk because of their experiences in the reproductive life stages of the perimenstrual, peripartum, and perimenopausal periods.The DSM-5 chapter on depressive disorders also included several changes from DSM-IV that have been the subject of significant scrutiny. The so-called bereavement exclusion has perhaps been the most discussed. It is widely understood that mourning the death of a loved one is a normal human reaction, and DSM-IV clarified that a 2-month period of bereavement was generally necessary before an MDD diagnosis could be made. Evidence indicated, however, that most grieving people do not develop the symptoms of MDD. In other words, MDD that occurs in the context of bereavement is not a \"normal\" reaction. The suffering of MDD tends to include more intense feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and suicidality, for example, and the functional decline is more severe. Furthermore, individuals who develop major depressive symptoms soon after the death of a loved one have elevated rates of depression in their personal and family histories, tend to have a worse prognosis, and tend to respond to antidepressant medications. In other words, individuals who develop all the characteristics of MDD following the death of a loved one are similar to people who develop MDD following any other serious stress and deserve the same level of clinical attention. DSM-5-TR extends this focus on grief by moving prolonged grief disorder from \"Conditions for Further Study\" (where it was called persistent complex bereavement disorder in DSM-5) into the main body of the text, where it is discussed in the chapter on trauma- and stressor-related disorders.Just as most grief is a normal reaction to loss, temper tantrums are a normal part of childhood. There are, however, children whose low frustration tolerance and behavioral dyscontrol transcend those of normal human experience; their affective dysregulation not only is distressing to their parents, teachers, and classmates, but also is upsetting to the affected children and threatens to derail their normal development. In DSM-5, these children were categorized as having disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD).Controversies about DMDD fall into two camps. In the first, there is concern that the diagnosis might pathologize normal childhood experience. In the second, there is a view that such behavior is more accurately described within the bipolar spectrum of disorders. Evidence indicates, however, that DMDD does describe a cluster ofprepubescent children who are significantly distressed and dysfunctional and who are at risk for a lifetime of difficulty. Furthermore, it appears that DMDD is not simply a childhood form of bipolar disorder. In fact, DMDD is much more likely to convert in adulthood to a depressive or an anxiety disorder than to a bipolar disorder.Another change from DSM-IV was the shift of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) from DSM-IV Appendix B (\"Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study\") into the main text of DSM-5. Just as DMDD does not refer to average expectable \"temper tantrums,\" PMDD does not describe the transient, mild symptoms that are commonly described as \"premenstrual syndrome.\" Instead, PMDD describes a robust cluster of symptoms that cause persistent, significant debility and distress.Concerns have been raised that these changes could lead to the pathologizing of normal human experience and, secondarily, to the excess use of psychiatric medication. The field of psychiatry should indeed recognize both the limitations of current evidence and the external forces that might try to influence the field for their own reward. At the same time, evidence does indicate that these new diagnoses reflect clusters of people who are suffering and significantly dysfunctional. It is also true that people meeting these criteria are often already seeking psychiatric help, and that the development of rigorous diagnostic criteria allows for replicable research into effective biopsychosocial interventions.Suggested ReadingsHaroz EE, Ritchey M, Bass JK, et al: How is depression experienced around the world?

Most recently, Wyatt had smashed a closet door to gain access to a video game that had been withheld to encourage him to do homework. At school, Wyatt was noted to have a hair-trigger temper, and he had recently been suspended for punching another boy in the face after losing a chess match.Wyatt had been an extremely active young boy, running \"all the time.\" He was also a \"sensitive kid\" who constantly worried that things might go wrong. His tolerance for frustration had been less than that of his peers, and his parents quit taking him shopping because he would predictably become distraught whenever they did not buy him whatever toys he wanted.Grade school reports indicated fidgetiness, wandering attention, and impulsivity. When Wyatt was 10 years old, a child psychiatrist diagnosed him as having attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combined type. Wyatt was referred to a behavioral therapist and started taking methylphenidate, which led to an improvement in his symptoms. However, by fourth grade, his moodiness became more pronounced and persistent. He was generally surly, complaining that life was \"unfair.\" Wyatt and his parents began their daily limit-setting battles at breakfast while he delayed getting ready for school, and then-by evening-continued their arguments about homework, videogames, and bedtime. These arguments often included Wyatt screaming and throwing nearby objects. By the time he reached sixth grade, his parents were tired and his siblings avoided him.According to Wyatt's parents, he had no problems with appetite, and although they fought about when he would go to bed, he did not appear to have a sleep disturbance. He appeared to find pleasure in his usual activities, maintained good energy, and had no history of elation, grandiosity, or decreased need for sleep lasting more than a day.Although they described him as \"moody, isolated, and lonely,\" his parents did not see him as depressed. They denied any history of hallucinations, abuse, trauma, suicidality, homicidality, a wish to self-harm, or any premeditated wish to harm others. He and his parents denied he had ever used alcohol or drugs. His medical history was unremarkable. His family history was notable for anxiety and depression in the father, alcoholism in the paternal grandparents, and possible untreated ADHD in the mother.On interview, Wyatt was mildly anxious yet easy to engage. His body twisted back and forth as he sat in the chair. In reviewing his temper outbursts and physical aggression, Wyatt said, \"It's like I can't help myself. I don't mean to do these things. But when I get mad, I don't think about any of that. It's like my mind goes blank.\" When asked how he felt about his outbursts, Wyatt looked very sad and said earnestly, \"I hate when I'm that way.\" If he could change three things in his life, Wyatt replied, \"I would have more friends, I would do better in school, and I would stop getting mad so much.\"", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\n Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation\n\nSuggested ReadingsBruno A, Celebre L, Torre G, et al: Focus on disruptive mood dysregulation disorder: a review of the literature.

In the ensuing 2 weeks, he had constant images of his son and was \"obsessed\" with how he might have prevented the substance abuse and suicide. He worried that he had been a bad father and that he had spent too much time on his own career and too little time with his son.

Her related guilt, in combination with her insomnia and fatigue, have made it very difficult for Ms. Smith to get her children to school on time. In the past few months, she had lost 13 pounds without dieting. She denied current suicidal ideation, saying she \"would never do something like that,\" but acknowledged having thought that she \"should just give up\" and that she \"would be better off dead.\" She decided to make an appointment after she attended her good friend's wedding and found she did not enjoy any of it.Two months previously, Ms. Smith had seen a psychiatrist for several weeks and received fluoxetine. She reluctantly gave it a try, discontinuing it quickly because it made her feel even more tired.

Her husband's parents lived next door. She said her marriage was good, although her husband suggested she \"go see someone\" so that she would not be \"pacing and yelling at everyone all the time.\" While historically sociable, she now rarely talked to her own mother and sisters, much less her friends. Previously a regular churchgoer, she had quit attending because she felt her faith was \"weak.\" Her pastor had always been supportive, but she had not contacted him with her problems because \"he wouldn't want to hear about these kinds of issues.\"Ms. Smith described herself as having been an outgoing, friendly child. She grew up with her parents and three siblings. She recalled feeling quite upset at age 10-11 when her parents divorced and her mom remarried. Because of fights with other kids at school, she met with a school counselor with whom she felt a bond. Unlike the psychiatrist she had recently consulted, Ms. Smith felt the counselor did not \"get into my business\" and helped her recover.

He had begun to drink alcohol to excess in social situations, sometimes embarrassing her. He often came home late, or not at all, claiming to have been at the office. When away from home, he rarely answered phone calls and text messages. She wondered if he was having an affair.

When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using cocaine several times per week for about 9 months.

He reported that he had withdrawn socially because he had lost pleasure in things that used to excite him, although he denied persistent feelings of sadness or worry. He recognized that he was not his \"usual self\" and tried, to no avail, to give himself \"pep talks.\" He had worked as a high school science teacher until retirement at age 67, and reported having learned \"the power of seeing the glass half full\" from his students. He felt frustrated that he could not \"snap out of it\" for the first time in his life but was hopeful about getting professional help. He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, \"God does not give me more than I can handle. I can't ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.\"Other new symptoms over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia.Further history on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something.His wife took over driving shortly after his Parkinson's disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications.

Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies.

Her speech was somewhat rapid and verbose but interruptible and nonpressured. She had no abnormal motor movements, but she gestured dramatically and with excessive animation. Her mood was depressed, and her affect was tense and dysphoric but with full range and normal responsivity.

When Mr. Campbell explained that he had been distracted by problems at home, his boss suggested that more seemed wrong. Mr.Campbell called his internist, who sent him to a neurologist, who referred him for psychiatric evaluation.Mr. Campbell had encountered this problem, difficulty concentrating, before. In college, after his father died of a chronic illness, Mr. Campbell had been unable to study and had taken time off. Twice at his prior job, he experienced episodes lasting months in which he had difficulty making decisions. One of these intervals followed a romantic setback.The patient's mother and sister had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and treated successfully with medication. A maternal uncle had committed suicide.The current impairment's onset accompanied the breakdown of Mr. Campbell's marriage of 6 years. Two months earlier, his wife had filed for divorce, announcing that she would live in the distant city her work had taken her to. Mr. Campbell had expected to feel relief; he said his wife had been hostile throughout the marriage. He had begun to entertain fond thoughts of a coworker. Nevertheless, he felt \"flat\"-unable to imagine a future.Closer questioning revealed that Mr. Campbell's problems went beyond impaired cognition. He described apathy and diminished energy. Jazz was a passion, but he no longer attended recitals-although impaired concentration probably played a role as well. Listening, the psychiatrist noted probable retardation of speech. Mr. Campbell said that his employer had mentioned that he was \"moving in slow motion.\" The problems were worse in the mornings. In the evenings, Mr. Campbell noticed a spark of energy. He put on music and reviewed reports that he had ignored during the workday.Mr. Campbell declined to characterize himself as sad. He was pleased that the marriage was ending. But the psychiatrist was struck by her own affect in Mr. Campbell's presence; she felt glum, pessimistic, even weepy.She questioned Mr. Campbell at length about depressed mood, changed sleep and appetite, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and thoughts of death. None of these attributions, he said, applied. Nor had he had indicators of disorders that can be confused with depression. Between episodes of impairment, he felt and functioned well.The psychiatrist decided that the problem at hand was close enough to depression to warrant treatment. Factors that influenced her decision included the partial syndromal presentation, diurnal variation, periodic recurrence, lack of future orientation, and her own empathic experience. She proposed psychotherapy centered on Mr. Campbell's decompensation in the face of loss. He insisted that he did not see the impending divorce in that light. The two agreed on brief psychotherapy supplemented by antidepressants.Within weeks, Mr. Campbell was functioning at full capacity. During the treatment, the psychiatrist was unable to elicit evidence of depressive symptoms beyond those noted in the initial history.

Her sleep had improved and her pain decreased, but she continued to feel tired all day. At that point, the internist referred her for the psychiatric evaluation.Ms. Fang had immigrated to the United States from Thailand a decade earlier. Natives of Laos, she and her family had spent almost two decades in a Thai refugee camp following the Vietnam War. Her family had resettled in the Sacramento area with the assistance of a local church group.When questioned through a Hmong interpreter, Ms. Fang denied depressed mood. When asked if she enjoyed things, she said that she felt privileged to be in America and had no right to complain. She said she felt she was not doing enough to help her family. She was embarrassed by her fatigue because she did not \"do anything all day.\" She denied any intention to harm herself.She said she was very proud of all her children, especially her son, who had been anexcellent student in Thailand and spoke good English. Nevertheless, her son, his wife, and their two young children followed many of the cultural practices that they had followed in Laos and Thailand, and often prepared Hmong food for dinner. He and his wife had bought a small farm outside Sacramento and were doing well, cultivating Asian vegetables. Her son had employed her two daughters on the farm until both had moved back to live in the Hmong community in Sacramento.Ms. Fang indicated that the transition to California had gone better than she had expected. The biggest disappointments for her had been her husband's unexpected death from a heart attack 1 year earlier and the fact that most of her extended family had remained in Thailand.On mental status examination, the patient was short and heavyset. She wore a floral short-sleeve blouse, black polyester slacks, black flip-flops, and no makeup. She had white strings tied around her wrists. Her eyes were generally downcast, but she seemed alert. She appeared sad and constricted but denied feeling depressed. Her speech was slow and careful. She denied all hallucinations, suicidality, and homicidality. Cognitive testing revealed normal attention and concentration. She had little formal education and appeared to be functionally illiterate. Her insight into her illness appeared limited.When asked about the strings around her wrists, Ms. Fang explained that she had recently sought out a Hmong shaman, who had organized several soul-calling ceremonies to reunite with distant relatives.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nOther specified depressive disorder (depressive episode with insufficient symptoms)\n\nSuggested ReadingsCulhane-Pera KA, Vawter DE, Xiong P, et al: Healing by Heart: Clinical and Ethical Case Stories of Hmong Families and Western Providers.

Barnhill, M.D.The DSM-5 chapter on anxiety disorders brings together a cluster of presentations in which anxiety, fear, and avoidance are prominent. Among the most prevalent psychiatric diagnoses, anxiety disorders can also be among the most difficult to definitively diagnose. One complicating factor is that anxiety, fear, and avoidance are normal and adaptive responses, leading to some inevitable ambiguity in evaluations of people with mild symptoms.Another complicating factor is that anxiety-related emotions can be experienced as physical symptoms. Fear-a normal response to a real or perceived imminent threat-is almost always associated with autonomic hyperarousal; such hyperarousal can be difficult for patients to identify or describe, especially if it is chronic. Similarly, anxiety- the emotional experience of fear unaccompanied by a clear threat-may be experienced as muscle tension and vigilance, which can blend imperceptibly into background noisefor someone with chronically elevated anxiety levels.A third complication is that anxiety disorders are often comorbid with one another and with mood, substance, and personality disorders, which can make it difficult to adequately attend to the manifestations of each diagnosis.Finally, definitions of anxiety disorders are descriptive of phenomena with unknown pathophysiologies, and despite many advances, the field of psychiatry is not yet close to definitively identifying nosological categories based on underlying etiology.DSM-5-TR maintains several changes that were initially made in DSM-5. For example, panic continues to be described in two different ways. Panic attacks are often comorbid, and they can now be identified as a specifier for all DSM-5-TR anxiety disorders, as well as for some other psychiatric disorders. When persistent panic attacks induce an ongoing, significant fear of further panic attacks, the more likely diagnosis is panic disorder.Historically linked to panic disorder, agoraphobia continues to be identified as a distinct diagnosis that can develop in the context of a variety of stressors and psychiatric syndromes. As with specific phobia and social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia no longer requires that individuals over age 18 perceive the anxiety as unreasonable. Instead, the clinician can make a judgment as to whether the anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger or threat. To reduce the likelihood of overdiagnosing transient fears, these disorders must persist for at least 6 months for all individuals rather than just for those under age 18.All of the DSM-5 structural changes were maintained in DSM-5-TR. For example, separation anxiety disorder was moved into the chapter on anxiety disorders from the chapter on neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnosis still requires an onset before age 18, but the chapter move is intended to encourage clinicians to recognize the 6% of adults who meet criteria for this childhood-onset disorder.DSM-5 also created two new chapters for conditions that had largely been conceptualized as anxiety disorders: disorders related to OCD (i.e., OCD as well as conditions such as body dysmorphic disorder) and disorders related to trauma andstress (i.e., PTSD as well as adjustment disorders). These new chapters include clusters of disorders in which anxiety may play a prominent role but which also have other features (e.g., obsessions/compulsions or a significant trauma history).DSM-5-TR describes temperamental traits often implicated in the development of anxiety symptoms. These include negative affectivity (or neuroticism), which refers to the disposition to experience negative emotions, and anxiety sensitivity, which refers to the disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are harmful. Also relevant to the anxiety disorders are such traits as behavioral inhibition, harm avoidance, and an attentional bias to threat.Cultural awareness is emphasized throughout DSM-5-TR. In addition to describing recent evidence regarding rates of anxiety disorders within subgroups based on gender, ethnicity, home country, and so on, DSM-5-TR encourages clinicians to maintain a broad sensitivity to culture, including a recognition that not all patients believe in a Western medical model of disease. Clinician curiosity into alternative explanatory models can improve the therapeutic alliance and patient adherence. For example, within Cambodian culture, khy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdl (wind) attacks involve dizziness, tinnitus, and neck soreness. Catastrophic cognitions and panic attacks can be triggered by the perceived dangerousness of a symptom, such as neck soreness, that may be understood to reflect disorder of khy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdl. The clinician would not be expected to know all culturally mediated disorders from all regions of the world, but a successful medical interaction might depend on listening for clues that the patient (or a respected parent or grandparent) has theories about medicine and health that do not conform to a Western medical model.Tactful interviewing can often lead to a more precise diagnosis and a more culturally sensitive treatment plan.Although anxiety is pervasive, and anxiety disorders are perhaps the most common psychiatric disorder, DSM-5 emphasizes that underdiagnosis of anxiety disorders can have serious consequences. Frequently misdiagnosed and undertreated, anxiety disorders are commonly associated with decreased work performance and life satisfaction and with increases in suicidality, disability days, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and medical resource use.The various anxiety-related disorders can often be clearly differentiated but are frequently comorbid with each other and with other psychiatric diagnoses, including major depressive disorder, personality disorders, and substance use disorders. A chief complaint of \"anxiety\" does not make the diagnosis but is instead the beginning of a clinical thought process that can range throughout DSM-5.Suggested ReadingsHofmann SG Hinton DE: Cross-cultural aspects of anxiety disorders.

"}, {"title": "Anxiety Disorders", "section": "5.1", "clinical_case": "Logan was a 12-year-old boy who was referred to mental health care for long-standing anxiety about losing his parents and relatively recent fears about getting a severe disease.Although his parents described a long history of anxiety, Logan's acute problem began 5 weeks prior to the consultation, when he watched a television show about rare and fatal diseases. Afterward, he became scared that he might have a hidden disease. His parents reported three \"panic attacks\" in the prior month, marked by anxiety, dizziness, sweats, and shortness of breath. About that same time, Logan began to complain of frequent headaches and stomachaches. Logan's own theory was that his bodily aches were causedby his fears about being ill and about his parents going away, but the pain was still uncomfortable. He insisted he was not scared about having more panic attacks but was petrified about being left sick and alone. These illness fears developed several times a week, usually when Logan was in bed, when he \"felt something\" in his body, or when he heard about diseases.Logan had begun to suffer from anxieties as a young child. Kindergarten was notable for intense separation difficulties. He was briefly bullied in third grade, which led to his first panic attacks and worsening anxiety. According to his parents, \"there always seemed to be a new anxiety.\" These included fear of the toilet, the dark, sleeping alone, being alone, and being pestered.Logan's most persistent fear revolved around his parents' safety. He was generally fine when both were at work or at home, but when they were in transit, or anywhere else, he was generally afraid that they would die in an accident. When the parents were late from work or when they tried to go out together or on an errand without him, Logan became frantic, calling and texting incessantly. Logan was predominantly concerned about his mother's safety, and she had gradually reduced her solo activities to a minimum. As she said, it felt like \"he would like to follow me into the toilet.\" Logan was less demanding toward his father, who believed his wife had been too soft and overprotective.Logan and his family underwent several months of psychotherapy when Logan was age10. The father said therapy helped his wife become less overprotective, and Logan's anxiety seemed to improve. Logan's mother agreed with this assessment, although she said she was not sure what she was supposed to do when her son was panicking whenever she tried to leave the house or whenever he worried about getting a disease.Logan's developmental history was otherwise unremarkable. His grades were generally good. His teachers agreed that he was quiet but had several friends and collaborated well with other children. He was quick, however, to negatively interpret the intentions of other children. For example, he tended to be very sensitive to any indication that he was being picked on.Logan's family history was pertinent for panic disorder, agoraphobia, and social anxiety disorder in the mother. The maternal grandmother was described as \"at least as\" anxiousas Logan's mother. The father denied psychiatric illness in his family.On examination, Logan was a friendly, articulate boy who was cooperative and goal directed. He was generally in a \"good mood\" but cried when talking about his fears of dying and getting sick. He denied suicidality and hopelessness but indicated he was desperate to get over his problems before starting high school. His cognition was good. His insight and judgment appeared intact except as related to his anxiety issues.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nSeparation anxiety disorder with panic attacks\n\nSuggested ReadingsAktar E, Van Bockstaele B, P\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdrez-Edgar K, et al: Intergenerational transmission of attentional bias and anxiety.

In the prior 2 months, she had presented to the emergency room four times for acute complaints of palpitations, shortness of breath, sweats, trembling, and the fear that she was about to die. Each of these events had a rapid onset. The symptoms peaked within minutes, leaving her scared, exhausted, and fully convinced that she had just experienced a heart attack. Medical evaluations done right after these episodes yielded normal physical exam findings, vital signs, lab results, toxicology screens, and electrocardiograms.The patient reported a total of five such attacks in the prior 3 months, with the panic occurring at work, at home, and while driving a car. She had developed a persistent fear of having other attacks, which led her to take many days off work and to avoid exercise, driving, and coffee. Her sleep quality declined, as did her mood. She avoided social relationships. She did not accept the reassurance offered to her by friends and physicians, believing that the medical workups were negative because they were performed after the resolution of the symptoms. She continued to suspect that something was wrong with her heart and that without an accurate diagnosis, she was going to die. When she had a panic attack while asleep in the middle of the night, she finally agreed to see a psychiatrist.Ms. Greco denied a history of previous psychiatric disorders except for a history of anxiety during childhood that had been diagnosed as a \"school phobia.\"The patient's mother had committed suicide by overdose 4 years earlier in the context of recurrent major depressive disorder. At the time of the evaluation, the patient was living with her father and two younger siblings. The patient had graduated from high school, was working as a telephone operator, and was not dating anyone. Her family and social histories were otherwise noncontributory.On examination, the patient was an anxious-appearing, cooperative, coherent young woman.

She added that the anxiety had been \"really bad\" for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become \"too nervous\" to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from \"a stranger at the counter\" for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.Nadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she \"just didn't feel like\" going out. Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide \"all the time.\" In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to \"feel pain and relieve stress.\" No one in the family was aware of this development.Nadine had always been \"shy\" and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten. The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine's peers turned on her \"like a snarling wolf pack,\" calling her \"stupid,\" \"ugly,\" and \"crazy.\" Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine's mother. When Nadine's mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had \"fallen\" on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother \"in passing\" that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.Full of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade. Although the bullying ceased,her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends \"trapped\" in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park.Nadine's social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia. She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew.Her parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college.Nadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and \"a little frightening.\" Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (\"He's more like me\"). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she \"never wanted to be anything like her mother.\"", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nSocial anxiety disorder, severe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nPosttraumatic stress disorder, moderate\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nAgoraphobia, severe\n\nSuggested ReadingBusch F, Milrod B, Chen C, Singer M: Trauma-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy: Bringing Evidence-Based Psychodynamic Treatment to Patients With PTSD.

He reported that he usually feels fine except when he is confronted with his inability to travel by airplane. His only daughter had delivered a baby in the prior year, and although he desperately wanted to meet his first granddaughter, he felt unable to fly across the Atlantic Ocean to where his daughter lived.The patient's anxiety about flying had begun 3 years earlier when he was on an airplane that landed during an ice storm. He had last flown a year earlier but had cried during both takeoff and landing; he had then found himself unable to return from that trip by airplane and instead took a train from Rome to Amsterdam. He had gone with his wife to an airport one additional time, 1 year prior to the evaluation, to fly to his daughter's wedding in the United States.

After that failed effort, he tended to feel intense anxiety when he even considered the possibility of flying. Anxiety about business trips had led him to decline a promotion as well as an external job offer.

Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. Prednisolone 40 mg/day was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.Outpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient's family expressed concern that he had recently become increasingly irritable and anxious and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings's primary care physician had recently prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful.When interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling \"great, better than I'd felt in years.\" For about a week after discharge, he described having enhanced energy and a sense of well-being, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime.He denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in themorning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life's challenges without being overwhelmed.His family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic.On mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, \"Something isn't right\" and \"It's not all in my head.\" His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations.

Barnhill, M.D.When evaluating a patient whose preoccupations and rituals have become persistent, excessive, and impairing, clinicians are encouraged to consider each of the disorders within the chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. These include obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder.Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and repetitive thoughts that often involve such concerns as pathological doubt, fear of contamination, somatic concerns, and a need for symmetry. Compulsions are the repetitive behaviors that are performed in response to the distress of the obsessions. Common compulsive behaviors include checking, ordering, cleaning, and mental rituals.Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by a preoccupation with one or morephysical flaws that are not readily apparent to others. In addition, a diagnosis of BDD requires repetitive behaviors (such as excessive grooming or reassurance seeking) and significant distress or dysfunction. If the preoccupation is primarily about weight, however, then that patient would receive an eating disorder diagnosis if diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder are met.Once a diagnosis is made, DSM-5 includes multiple specifiers for many of its diagnoses. OCD, BDD, and hoarding disorder are unusual in having an \"insight\" specifier. The insight specifier characterizes patients as having good or fair insight, poor insight, or absent insight/delusional beliefs. For example, people who are delusionally convinced that their BDD beliefs are true would not be coded as having a comorbid psychotic disorder (e.g., delusional disorder) but would instead be noted to have BDD with absent insight.Trichotillomania (hair-pulling), and excoriation (skin-picking) are the most common body-focused, repetitive behavior disorders. Hair-pulling disorder was previously listed among the impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified, along with such disorders as pyromania and intermittent explosive disorder. Skin-picking disorder was new in DSM-5. Both disorders involve the sort of persistent, repetitive dysfunctional behaviors that characterize all of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.Hoarding disorder was also new in DSM-5. It was previously listed as a possible criterion for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder or considered a symptom of OCD. In some cases, hoarding-type behavior is a symptom of OCD (e.g., if trash accumulates because of fears of becoming contaminated by touching it), but evidence indicates that dysfunctional hoarding often exists without an accompanying OCD diagnosis.As continues to be true throughout much of DSM-5, this chapter includes categories for patients whose symptoms are assessed to be secondary to medications, substances, or another medical condition. DSM-5 also allows clinicians to identify clinically relevant conditions that do not meet full criteria for a disorder. For example, a presentation that meets criteria for body dysmorphic disorder in a person who has significant physical flaws-a circumstance that would preclude the use of that diagnosis (which requires that any physical flaws be no more than \"slight\")-could be recorded as \"other specifiedobsessive-compulsive and related disorder (body dysmorphic-like disorder with actual flaws).\" The \"other specified\" diagnosis might also be used to refer to a symptom cluster not described in the criteria for any DSM-5 obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, such as obsessional jealousy or olfactory reference disorder. \"Unspecified\" disorders can refer to symptom clusters that resemble presentations found in a particular DSM-5 chapter but that do not meet criteria for any specific disorder; the unspecified diagnosis is often used when the clinician has insufficient clinical information to make a diagnosis, such as in an emergency evaluation or an initial consultation.Suggested ReadingsPhillips K, Stein DJ (eds): Handbook on Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders.

He had been struggling with depressive symptoms for years and had tried fluoxetine, citalopram, and supportive psychotherapy, with minor improvement. He worked full-time but engaged in very few activities outside of work.When asked how he felt, Mr. King said that his mood was low, he was unable to enjoy things, and he had insomnia, feelings of hopelessness, low energy, and difficulty concentrating and making decisions. He denied current suicidality but added that a few years earlier, he had taken a full bottle of medication with the intent to kill himself. He reported that he had done this during a time that he was abusing alcohol. He denied current alcohol or illicit substance use.When asked about anxiety, Mr. King said he was worried about contracting diseases such as HIV. Aware of an unusually strong disinfectant smell, the interviewer asked the patient if he had any particular cleaning behaviors related to the HIV concerns. Mr. King paused and clarified that he avoided touching practically anything outside of his home.When further encouraged, Mr. King said that if he even came close to things that he considered potentially contaminated, he had to wash his hands incessantly with household bleach. He described that he felt like \"something was still there\" in his hands and he had to wash his hands until it felt that he had finally done it \"right.\"On average, Mr. King washed his hands up to 30 times a day, spending hours on this routine. Physical contact was particularly difficult. Shopping for groceries and taking public transportation were a big problem, and he had almost given up trying to socialize or engage in romantic relationships. These behaviors had only intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, though a co-worker liked to joke that Mr. King had been cleaning and social distancing for years before it became fashionable.When asked if he had other worries, Mr. King replied that he had intrusive images of hitting someone, fears that he would say things that might be offensive or inaccurate, and concerns about disturbing his neighbors. To counteract the anxiety produced by these images and thoughts, he constantly replayed prior conversations in his mind, kept diaries to record what he said, and often apologized for fear he might have sounded offensive. When he showered, he made sure that the water in the tub only reached a certain level for fear that if he were not attentive, he would flood his neighbors.Mr. King used gloves at work and performed well. He had no medical problems. He spent most of his free time at home. Although he enjoyed the company of others, the fear of having to touch something if he was invited to a meal or to another person's home was too much for him to handle.The examination revealed a casually dressed man who smelled strongly of bleach. He was worried and constricted but cooperative, coherent, and goal directed. He denied hallucinations and other strongly held ideas. He denied a current intention to hurt himself or others. He was cognitively intact. He recognized that his fears and urges were \"kinda crazy,\" but he felt they were out of his control.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nObsessive-compulsive disorder, with good or fair insight\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nMajor depressive disorder\n\nSuggested ReadingsHollander E, Zohar J, Sirovatka, Regier DA (eds): Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders: Refining the Research Agenda for DSM-V.

She noted that since adolescence, her son had been concerned with germs, which led to long-standing hand-washing and showering rituals. During the prior 6 months, his symptoms had markedly worsened. He had become preoccupied with being infected by COVID-19 and spent the day cleaning not only his body but all of his clothing and linen. He had begun to insist that the family also wash their clothing and linen regularly, and that they keep the windows shut all the time. He allowed no visitors to their home. When the parents were occasionally exposed to other people by going outside, he insisted that they wear their masks in his presence for the ensuing 48 hours. The resulting conflicts had led to the current consultation.Mr. Lewis had in the past received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and cognitive- behavioral therapy for his symptoms. These had had some positive effects, and he had been able to complete high school successfully. Nevertheless, his symptoms had prevented him from completing college or working outside the home; he had long felt that his home was relatively germ-free in comparison to the outside world. However, over the past 6 months, he had increasingly indicated that home, too, was contaminated, including with COVID-19.At the time of presentation, Mr. Lewis had no other obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms such as sexual, religious, or other obsessions; appearance oracquisition preoccupations; or body-focused repetitive behaviors. However, in the past he had also experienced obsessions relating to fears of harming himself or others, together with associated checking compulsions (e.g., checking that the stove was switched off). He had a childhood history of motor tics. During high school, he found that marijuana reduced his anxiety. He denied having had access to marijuana and other psychoactive substances since leaving school.Mr. Lewis was interviewed over video using a telehealth system. He appeared disheveled and unkempt. He was completely convinced that COVID-19 had contaminated his home and that his washing and cleaning were necessary to stay uninfected. When challenged with information about COVID-19's mode of spread, he answered that COVID-19 might come into the home through an open window or the sweat of visitors, and his masked parents could certainly get infected by going to the grocery store. He added that his parents had tried to convince him that he was excessively worried, but he did not believe them. In fact, his worries kept returning even when he tried to think of something else.There was no evidence of hallucinations or of a formal thought disorder.

Although he looked normal, Mr. Mancini was completely convinced that he looked \"ugly and hideous,\" and he believed that other people talked about him and made fun of him because of his appearance.Mr. Mancini spent 5-6 hours a day compulsively checking his disliked body areas in mirrors and other reflecting surfaces such as windows, excessively styling his hair \"tocreate an illusion of fullness,\" pulling on his ears to try to \"even them up,\" and comparing his appearance with that of others. He compulsively picked his skin, sometimes using razor blades, to try to \"clear it up.\" He lifted weights daily and regularly wore several layers of T-shirts to look bigger. He almost always wore a cap to hide his hair. He had received dermatological treatment for his skin concerns but felt it had not helped.Mr. Mancini missed several months of high school because he was too preoccupied to do schoolwork, felt compelled to leave class to check mirrors, and was too self-conscious to be seen by others; for these reasons, he was unable to attend college. He became socially withdrawn and did not date \"because no girl would want to go out with someone as ugly as me.\" He often considered suicide because he felt that life was not worth living \"if I look like a freak\" and because he felt isolated and ostracized because of his \"ugliness.\" His parents expressed concern over his \"violent outbursts,\" which occurred when he was feeling especially angry and distressed over how he looked or when they tried to pull him away from the mirror.Mr. Mancini reported depressed mood, anhedonia, worthlessness, poor concentration, and suicidal ideation, all of which he attributed to his appearance concerns. To self- medicate his distress over his appearance, he drank alcohol and smoked marijuana. He used protein powder to \"build up muscle\" but denied use of anabolic steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs or drugs of abuse. He had distressing and problematic anxiety in social situations during his late teens that he attributed to feeling \"stupid,\" but he denied recent social anxiety that was unrelated to his appearance concerns.Mr. Mancini had no significant medical history and was taking no medication.

She had never taken any psychiatric medication but had completeda course of cognitive-behavioral therapy for a previous depressive episode 5 years earlier.Ms. Nichols's medical history was unremarkable. She lived alone in a two-bedroom apartment and had no family or friends nearby. She had a university degree and worked as a part-time sales assistant in a charity thrift shop. She said she had dated in college but had \"somehow been too busy\" in recent years.On initial examination, she was an articulate, well-dressed woman who was coherent and cooperative. She was clearly in a low mood. She complained about poor concentration and difficulties getting organized. She denied any substance misuse.The clinician noted that Ms. Nichols's purse was filled with bills and other papers. When asked, the patient initially shrugged it off, indicating that she \"carried around my office.\" When the interviewer inquired further, it emerged that Ms. Nichols had had difficulty discarding important business papers, newspapers, and magazines for as long as she could remember. She felt that it all started when her mother got rid of her old toys when she was age 12. Now, many years later, Ms. Nichols's apartment had become filled with books, stationery, crafts, plastic packages, cardboard boxes, and all sorts of other things. She said she knew it was a little crazy, but these items could be handy one day. She said, \"Waste not, want not.\" She also reported that many of her possessions were beautiful, unique, and irreplaceable, or had strong sentimental value. The thought of discarding any of these possessions caused her great distress.Over a series of interviews, the clinician developed a clearer understanding of the extent of the problem. Rooms in Ms. Nichols's apartment had begun to fill when she was in her early 30s, and by the time of the interview, she had little room to live. Her kitchen was almost entirely full, so she used a mini fridge and a toaster oven that she had wedged into piles of paper in the hallway. She ate her meals in the only available chair. At night, she moved a pile of papers from the bed onto that chair so she could sleep. Ms. Nichols continued to buy from the charity thrift store where she worked and also picked up daily free newspapers that she planned to read in the future.Embarrassed by the condition of her apartment, she had told no one about her behavior and had invited no one into her apartment for at least 15 years. She also avoided social functions and dating, because-despite being naturally sociable and very lonely-sheknew she would be unable to reciprocate with invitations to her home. She was surprised to have told the clinician, because she had not told even her own mother, but she would like help. She declined the clinician's offer of a home visit or a telehealth visit but did offer some photographs of her living room from her telephone's camera. The photographs showed furniture, papers, boxes, and clothes piled from floor to ceiling.Ms. Nichols described long-standing feelings of sadness and loneliness, as well as anxiety whenever she tried to clean up or whenever someone tried to befriend her.

She had never previously told anyone other than her mother about her hair pulling, but the magazine had indicated that it was fairly common and treatable. She was pessimistic that anything would work, but she and her mother agreed that she should seek help.Ms. Oliver's hair pulling most often took place as a ritual when she returned home from her job as a paralegal. She would search for hairs of a particular texture from the crown of her head (though she also pulled from her eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic region). She felt intense relief if the hair came out with its root. She would then typically bite off the root of the hair and swallow the rest of the hair. She had never experienced any gastrointestinal symptoms after hair swallowing. She said the hair pulling had begun at age 12, and she had never known anyone with similar behaviors.Ms. Oliver fought hard to stop the behavior and, at times, had been able to stop for several months at a time. When the hair pulling returned, she would again feel ashamed and angry at herself. Scarves and hats covered the bald patch, but she would usually withdraw from friends and boyfriends to avoid being caught.Even when demoralized about the behavior, Ms. Oliver did not have vegetative symptoms of depression. Aside from fears of being found out, she lacked prominent anxiety. She denied obsessions, compulsions, hoarding, tics, and preoccupations with either bodily defects or having an illness. She also had no history of a range of other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as lip biting or cheek chewing, in either herselfor her close family members.When asked what she would do if she could not find the \"right\" kind of hair to pull, she admitted that she would often pick at her skin or at a scab. The scab's coming off in just the right way led to a feeling of relief that was similar to that which she experienced when hair pulling. She would also sometimes chew and swallow her scabs. Ms. Oliver often picked at scabs on her back so that the lesions would not be easily visible to others. Nevertheless, the resultant scarring did lead her to avoid situations like beach parties and dates and other situations where her behavior might be exposed.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nTrichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder)\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nExcoriation (skin-picking) disorder\n\nSuggested ReadingsGrant JE, Chamberlain SR: Trichotillomania.

Barnhill, M.D.The chapter on trauma- and stressor-related disorders consists of a cluster of disorders that require identification of a triggering external event. This was a new chapter in DSM-5. Previously, all of the disorders had been listed in other chapters. This chapter also features the only diagnosis that is new to the main DSM-5-TR text: prolonged grief disorder, which in DSM-5 had been listed in the \"Conditions for Further Study\" chapter in Section III, where it was called persistent complex bereavement disorder.Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (ASD) were moved from the chapter on anxiety disorders. Both PTSD and ASD are characterized by heterogeneous symptoms, not only anxiety, and one consequence of this classification change was to emphasize the importance of assessing the breadth of reactions to an external trauma or stressor. At the same time, both disorders often present with prominent anxiety, and an alternative conceptualization of both PTSD and ASD wouldcharacterize them on an anxiety spectrum of disorders, alongside, for example, obsessive-compulsive disorder, which was also moved from the anxiety disorders into its own chapter in DSM-5.A PTSD diagnosis requires the presence of symptoms from each of four symptom clusters: intrusion symptoms (previously known as reexperiencing), avoidance symptoms, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and arousal symptoms. DSM-5 more explicitly recognized the heterogeneity of acute post-trauma response by eliminating the requirement that individuals with ASD have symptoms from multiple symptom clusters. Instead, it is necessary to have at least nine of 14 symptoms. In practice, this could mean that one individual with ASD could have all four intrusion symptoms, whereas another might have none.PTSD and ASD are most clearly delineated by duration, with PTSD persisting at least 1 month after the external event and ASD lasting no more than 1 month. For both PTSD and ASD, the initial stressor criterion now specifies whether the trauma was experienced, witnessed, or experienced indirectly. Unlike DSM-IV, DSM-5 did not require an assessment of the patient's initial subjective response for either disorder.Finally, diagnostic thresholds for PTSD were lowered for children and adolescents, and a preschool subtype was added.Two of the chapter's disorders-reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED)-are initially found in childhood, although both may have lifelong consequences. Children with RAD have responded to the absence of expectable caregiving by a cluster of withdrawn and inhibited symptoms, whereas those with DSED have symptoms described as indiscriminately social and disinhibited.Adjustment disorder had previously served as a residual category for people who were distressed but did not meet criteria for a more discrete disorder. The adjustment disorders were reconceptualized in DSM-5 as an array of stress-response syndromes that occur after exposure to a distressing event. As in DSM-IV, the adjustment disorders should include a specifier that identifies the predominant disturbance (e.g., depressed mood, anxiety, disturbance of conduct, or a combination).It has long been recognized that it is normal for people to grieve the death of a loved one.Clinicians and researchers have increasingly identified a subgroup of people whose emotional reaction appears to be excessive in intensity for over a year. The diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder has been introduced within the main body of DSM-5-TR to meet this clinical concern.DSM-5-TR explores the growing evidence that culture affects clinical expression. For example, non-Western groups appear to respond to PTSD with less avoidance and more somatic symptoms such as dizziness and shortness of breath. Although DSM-5-TR emphasizes categories of disorders, it also includes discussion of how developmental issues can affect symptomatology. For example, children younger than 6 years can be traumatized by life-threatening events such as the threat of abandonment, and a primary presenting complaint might be nightmares, with or without traumatic content.The trauma- and stressor-related disorders can usefully bring together seemingly unrelated symptoms. For example, an adult might present with complaints related to anxiety, depression, paranoia, social isolation, and substance use. Without a careful history that looks for trauma, the clinician might conceptualize the patient as having half a dozen diagnoses rather than a single trauma- and stressor-related diagnosis that synthesizes a disparate set of problems. At the same time, comorbidities are common among the disorders discussed in this chapter, and, if found, should generally be identified along with the disorder directly related to the trauma or stress.Suggested ReadingsDoric A, Stevanovic D, Stupar D, et al: UCLA PTSD reaction index for DSM-5 (PTSD- RI-5): a psychometric study of adolescents sampled from communities in eleven countries.

At the time of the adoption, Adriana's medical records were reviewed by a local pediatrician, who found no problems aside from growth parameters that were all below the 5th percentile. When the adoptive parents met her at the orphanage, Adriana approached without shyness and visited easily with them. The parents had been pleasantly reassured by the child's happy demeanor and her spontaneous, warm hugs.Not long after her adoption, Adriana began to clearly seek out her mother for comfort when distressed or hurt. At most other times, however, Adriana did not distinguish between strangers and her family. In the grocery store, she would warmly hug whoever was waiting next to them in line. In group and family settings, she would frequently try to sit in the laps of people she had barely met. Once, at a shopping mall, she tried to leave with another family. Her parents were concerned that this behavior might put her at risk of abduction or abuse.Compared with other children her age, Adriana had trouble taking turns and sitting for circle time at school. She interrupted, intruded into classmates' play space, and occasionally hit others. Small triggers upset her for prolonged periods. She had trouble soothing herself but would generally calm down if held by her teacher or a parent.Adriana lived with her adoptive mother and father and her 12-year-old brother, who was the biological child of her parents. Her mother stayed home for Adriana's first year in theUnited States, but Adriana had been attending a half-day child care program for the past year. Her mother noted progress in the child's development, although she remained language delayed, with comprehension better than productive language. She was slower than classmates in developing school readiness skills, but her gross and fine motor skills were considered average. Her sleep and appetite were fine. She had gained weight, but her head circumference remained just below the 5th percentile.On examination, she was a pleasant, well-groomed girl who appeared younger than her age.

She saw many people get shot, including the woman sitting next to her. People all around began screaming, and there was a confused stampede for the exit door. Terrified, she somehow fought her way to the exit and escaped, uninjured, to the parking lot, where police cars were just arriving.Charles Quigley, age 25, went to the same movie theater at the same time. He too feared for his life. Hiding behind a row of seats, he was able to crawl to the aisle and sprint to the exit.

They jumped at the slightest noise. They kept watching television for the latest information about the shooting, but every time there was actual videotaped footage of the event, they experienced panic attacks, broke out into a sweat, were unable to calm down, and could not stop thinking about the traumatic event. They could not sleep at night because of nightmares, and during the day they felt assaulted by intrusive and unwelcome memories of gunshots, screams, and their own personal terror during the event.Bethany, 2 Weeks Later: Ms. Pinsky had reclaimed most of her pretraumatic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors within 2 weeks. Although traumatic reminders of the shooting sometimes led to a brief panic or physiological reaction, these did not dominate her waking hours. She no longer experienced nightmares.

On the day of the accident, Dylan was riding in the front passenger seat when, as the car was pulling out of a driveway, it was struck by an oncoming SUV that was speeding through a yellow light. The car he was in was hit squarely on the driver's side, which caused the car to roll over once and come to rest right side up. The collision of metal on metal made an extremely loud noise. The driver of the car, a high school classmate, was knocked unconscious for a short period and was bleeding from a gash in his forehead.Upon seeing his injured friend, Dylan became afraid that his friend might be dead. His friend in the back seat of the car was frantically trying to unlatch her seat belt. Dylan'sdoor was jammed, and Dylan feared that their car might catch fire while he was stuck in it. After a few minutes, the driver, Dylan, and the other passenger were able to exit through the passenger doors and move away from the car. They realized that the driver of the SUV was unharmed and had already called the police. An ambulance was on its way. All three were transported to a local emergency room, where they were attended to and released to their parents' care after a few hours.Dylan had not had a good night's sleep since the accident. He often awoke in the middle of the night with his heart racing, visualizing oncoming headlights. He was having trouble concentrating and was unable to effectively complete his homework. His parents, who had begun to drive him to and from school, noticed that he was anxious every time they pulled out of a driveway or crossed an intersection. Although he had recently received his driving permit, he refused to practice driving with his father. He was also unusually short-tempered with his parents, his younger sisters, and his friends. He had recently gone to see a movie but had walked out of the theater before the movie started; he complained that the sound system was too loud. His concerned parents tried to talk to him about his stress, but he would irritably cut them off. After doing poorly on an important exam, however, he accepted the encouragement of a favorite teacher to go to a psychiatrist.When seen, Dylan described additional difficulties. He hated that he was \"jumpy\" around loud noises, and he could not shake the image of his injured and unresponsive friend. He had waves of anger toward the driver of the SUV. He reported feeling embarrassed and disappointed in himself for being reluctant to practice driving. He stated that about 5 years earlier, he had witnessed the near-drowning of one of his younger sisters.

When unexpectedly startled by sudden noises, he tended to fly into a rage. That was apparently one reason he had chosen to be a self-employed electrician: he could work by himself.Similarly, he enjoyed hunting and gardening, activities that he could enjoy in quiet solitude.Reluctantly, he described intrusive memories of watching his fellow soldiers die in the field, which caused him enormous shame, guilt, and sadness, Several times a week, he awakes in a panicky sweat after a combat nightmare, although, as he said, \"It's ridiculous. Those guys have been dead for 50 years.\"Although these symptoms are very distressing, Mr. Reynolds is most worried about his \"hair-trigger\" temper. Without cause, he finds himself antagonizing other drivers who cut him off, confronting strangers who stand too close to him in checkout lines, and shifting into \"attack mode\" when approached from behind by others. He springs into this aggressive mode automatically, without a thought or consideration of the circumstances. Although he keeps a handgun in the console of his car for self-protection, Mr. Reynolds has no intention of harming others. He is always remorseful after a threatening incident and worries that he might inadvertently hurt someone. Most recently, while drifting offto sleep on his physician's examination table, a nurse touched his foot, and he leapt up and began cursing in a threatening manner. He felt as if he were back on guard duty, when he was accidentally dozing, and an incoming mortar round stunned him into action. His reaction scared both the nurse and himself.Mr. Reynolds's symptoms apparently began soon after he left Vietnam, where he served as a field radio operator. He never sought help for his symptoms, apparently because of his independent and self-reliant nature. After retirement as a self-employed electrician, he spent almost all of his time at home. During these past few years, his wife and adult children became more aware of his various symptoms, including how they were putting a severe strain on his family relationships and overall happiness.Mr. Reynolds was raised in a loving family that struggled financially as Midwestern farmers. At age 20, Mr. Reynolds was drafted into the U.S. Army and deployed to Vietnam. He described himself as having been upbeat and happy prior to his army induction. He said he enjoyed basic training and his first few weeks in Vietnam, until one of his comrades got killed. At that point, all he cared about was getting home alive, even if it meant killing others. His personality changed from that of a happy-go-lucky farm boy to a terrified, overprotective soldier. Upon returning to civilian life, he managed to get a graduate business degree, but he became a self-employed electrician because of his need to stay isolated in his work. In his retirement, he hoped to volunteer, garden, and get some \"peace and quiet.\" It turned out, however, that his retirement was much like the rest of his adult life: although he could occasionally settle into one of his hobbies, most of his days were filled with tension, guilt, and arguments.Despite having used alcohol and marijuana during his early adulthood, he had not consumed excessive alcohol for several decades or used marijuana since the age of 30. He had no legal history.On examination, Mr. Reynolds was a well-groomed man who appeared anxious and somewhat guarded. He was coherent and articulate. His speech was at a normal rate, but the pace accelerated when he discussed disturbing content. He denied depression but was anxious. His affect was somewhat constricted but appropriate to content. His thought process was coherent and linear. He denied all suicidal and homicidal ideation.He had no psychotic symptoms, delusions, or hallucinations. He had very good insight.

Ms. Trentino had already been through several rounds of chemotherapy over the prior few months.

After performing verywell at their medical school and during the first 2 years of surgery training, Dr. Ulysse was now manifesting some problems, with his most recent performance review being notable for uncharacteristic sloppiness and lateness. Dr. Ulysse had shrugged off two referrals, but after being told that he was being released from work until he got clearance from psychiatry, he agreed to an evaluation.Dr. Ulysse stated that he was fine, \"just a little burned out.\" He'd always prided himself on having more energy than everyone else, but he'd started getting worn down during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said he was sleeping poorly, was always tired, and was having trouble concentrating. After about 20 minutes, he asked if he could leave, that he felt better already. The psychiatrist explained that she would need to meet with him at least a few times before she could allow him to go back to work.Reminded that he wasn't yet ready to go back to work, Dr. Ulysse appeared to slump in his seat. When the psychiatrist asked him to say more, he replied that he hated being this way, hated being weak.He said he knew he had burnout. He'd read up on it, and he felt exhausted, cynical about his being a \"cog in the medical-industrial complex,\" and less able to finish his daily work. He thought he might also have a depressive disorder, given that he was sad just about every day and also felt tired, worthless, and unable to sleep and concentrate normally.He said this had been going on for 12 or 18 months, but he'd been \"good at hiding things until recently.\" Dr. Ulysse asked whether the psychiatrist could diagnose him with burnout, since he'd prefer not to get a label that is a \"career killer, at least for a surgeon.\" He said he would be completely adherent with an antidepressant medication if the psychiatrist would let him go back to work. When asked if he felt suicidal, he responded that he had always thought that was a ridiculous question: \"If you're really serious about suicide, why tell somebody who has 911 on speed dial? But no, I'm not going to kill myself.\"At this point, the psychiatrist asked for more background information. Dr. Ulysse was the only child born to a pharmacist and a French professor, who had left Haiti when he was born. He had grown up in a suburban area where he was often the only Black child in his grade. When asked if that was difficult for him, he looked skeptical. \"Yeah,\" hesaid, \"I know all about microaggressions and structural racism, all that stuff, but my strategy was to always be smarter, funnier, nicer, and more athletic than everybody else. I always had a confident smile on my face, and now nothing makes me happy. My nickname at my fancy high school was Superman. I literally dated the homecoming queen, and nobody seemed to mind about the Black/white thing.\" At that point, he laughed and added, \"well, except for my Gran, my dad's mother, who lived with us when I was growing up. She thought I was asking for trouble.\"After a few moments of silence, Dr. Ulysse began to quietly cry. When asked to say more, he explained that his parents worked \"all the time\" when he was young, so his grandmother lived with them and took care of him throughout his school years. She had died of COVID-19 about 18 months earlier. Since then, he described thinking about her \"all the time\" and having become increasingly preoccupied by his failure to convince her to get the COVID vaccine.He said he knew it was ridiculous, but he had partially believed her when she had insisted that she was able to protect everyone in the family from the virus. \"Did I mention my Gran was a Catholic witch, and a very good one?\" Dr. Ulysse added that although he knew she was dead, part of him continued to expect her to walk through the door, and he looked up multiple times every day, expecting her to be there. He spent long hours reviewing his inability to convince her to get the vaccine as well as his decision not to visit her for months for fear of infecting her. He awoke with nightmares most nights. He didn't remember the content of the dreams very well, but they tended to be about his grandmother disappearing and him being unable to help. He noted that he had become increasingly angry and bitter at colleagues, his parents, and his ex- girlfriend. Since she had moved out of their apartment 6 months earlier, he hadn't spoken to her or seen any of his friends. His parents called frequently and have tried to \"kidnap\" him for a weekend with family, but they appear to have gotten frustrated that he was being so stubborn. He said that he was okay watching TV-where he focused on \"pestilence and wars\"-but he just felt too numb to talk to people. He also stated that he barely knew who he was anymore, and that his job as a surgery trainee had come to seem irrelevant if it meant that he couldn't even help his family.

Dissociative Disorders? Full AccessEdited by:John W. Barnhill, M.D., Richard J. Loewenstein, M.D., Daphne Simeon, M.D., Roberto Lewis-Fern\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdndez, M.D.https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9781615375295.jb08IntroductionJohn W. Barnhill, M.D.Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms.DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders-dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder-as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder-other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediatelyafter the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders.Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation.In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]).DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately.A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent.Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder.DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option-\"other specified dissociative disorder\"-for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).Suggested ReadingsLaddis A, Dell PF, Korzekwa M: Comparing the symptoms and mechanisms of \"dissociation\" in dissociative identity disorder and borderline personality disorder.

She reported greater benefit from psychotherapies based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy had been suggested, but she had refused. She had been hospitalized twice for suicidal ideation and severe self-cutting that required stitches.Ms. Vaughan reported that previous therapists had focused on the likelihood of trauma, but she casually dismissed the possibility that she had ever been abused. It had been her younger sister who had reported \"weird sexual touching\" by their father when Ms.Vaughan was 13. There had never been a police investigation, but her father had apologized to the patient and her sister as part of a resultant church intervention and an inpatient treatment for alcoholism and \"sex addiction.\" She denied any feelings about these events and said, \"He took care of the problem. I have no reason to be mad at him.\"Ms. Vaughan reported little memory for her life between the ages of about 7 and 13 years. Her siblings would joke about her inability to recall family holidays, school events, and vacation trips. She explained her amnesia by saying, \"I don't remember anything because nothing happened.\"She reported a \"good\" relationship with both parents. Her father remained \"controlling\" toward her mother and still had \"anger issues,\" but had been abstinent from alcohol for 16 years. On closer questioning, Ms. Vaughan reported that her self-injurious and suicidal behavior primarily occurred after visits to see her family or when her parents surprised her by visiting.Ms. Vaughan described being \"socially withdrawn\" until high school, at which point she became academically successful and a member of numerous teams and clubs. She did well in college. She excelled at her job and was regarded as a gifted teacher of autistic children. She described several friendships of many years. She reported difficulty with intimacy with men, experiencing intense fear and disgust at any attempted sexual advances. Whenever she did get at all involved with a man, she felt intense shame and a sense of her own \"badness,\" although she felt worthless at other times as well. Shetended to sleep poorly and often felt tired.She denied use of alcohol or drugs. She added that even the smell of alcohol made her feel like throwing up.On mental status examination, the patient was well groomed and cooperative. Her responses were coherent and goal directed, but often devoid of emotional content. She appeared sad and constricted. She described herself as \"numb.\" She denied hallucinations, confusion, and a current intention to kill herself. However, thoughts of suicide were \"always around.\"More specific questions led Ms. Vaughan to deny that she had ongoing amnesia for daily life, particularly denying ever being told of behavior she could not recall, unexplained possessions, subjective time loss, fugue episodes, or inexplicable fluctuations in skills, habits, and/or knowledge. She denied a sense of subjective self-division, hallucinations, inner voices, or passive influence symptoms. She denied flashbacks or intrusive memories, but she did report recurrent nightmares of being chased by \"a dangerous man\" from whom she could not escape. She reported difficulty concentrating, although she was \"hyperfocused\" at work. She reported an intense startle reaction. She said that she often found herself silently counting and singing rather than let herself daydream.She added that she was very careful, checking multiple times every night to ensure that her doors were locked. When she got anxious, she found that rearranging her furniture helped her feel safer.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nDissociative amnesia\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nMajor depressive disorder, chronic, with suicidal ideation\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nPosttraumatic stress disorder\n\n\nSuggested ReadingsBrand BL, Loewenstein RJ, Spiegel D: Dispelling myths about dissociative identity disorder treatment: an empirically based approach.

Mr. Waldron did not attend the evaluation session, telling his RA that \"everybody gets bummed after a breakup-I'll be fine.\" When Mr. Waldron seemed \"strange and out of it,\" his RA made another appointment and then accompanied Ken to the meeting.In that initial session, Mr. Waldron was hesitant but revealed that he had been crushed by the breakup. While he had previously been an excellent student, he'd quit doing homework and just looked out the window during class. He noticed that his grades had declined markedly, but \"I don't seem to care.\" Although he said he felt lonely, he also admitted to steadily deleting incoming texts, so that he rarely communicated with his friends and family.When asked to describe other symptoms of depression, Mr. Waldron replied that he didn't have anything to say. He said that his mind felt blank, \"as usual.\" He added that he also felt increasingly detached from his physical body, going about his daily activities \"like a robot.\" He said he felt so disconnected that he often wondered if he were dead or living in a dream, or just had \"no self.\"Mr. Waldron said that he'd been depressed for a few weeks after the breakup. He said he'd never been in love before and was shocked when Jill told him she needed \"time apart.\" For weeks afterward, he felt sad and a little desperate, but he'd continued to see friends and go to class; however, at some point, things began to change. He said he started feeling numb, unreal, and disconnected, but it was all a little fuzzy.Mr. Waldron described a time-limited bout of extreme anxiety in tenth grade. At that time, panic attacks had begun and then escalated in severity and frequency over 2 months. During those attacks, he had felt very detached, as if everything around him was unreal. The symptoms sometimes lasted for several hours and were reminiscent of his current complaints. The onset appeared to coincide with his mother's entry into a psychiatric hospital. When she was discharged, all of his symptoms cleared rapidly. He did not seek treatment at that time.Mr. Waldron also described experiencing transient feelings of unreality in elementary school, just after his parents divorced and his father left young Jason and his mother, who had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. His childhood was significant for pervasive loneliness and the sense that he was the only adult in the family. His mother was only marginally functional, with a few actively psychotic episodes. His father rarely visited but did provide enough money for them to continue to live in reasonable comfort. Jason often stayed with his grandparents on weekends, but in general, he and his mother lived a very isolated life. He did well in school and had a few close friends, but he largely kept to himself and rarely brought friends home. Jill would have been the first girlfriend to meet his mother.Mr. Waldron denied using any drugs, in particular cannabis, hallucinogens, or ketamine, and his urine toxicology was negative. Although his home life featured emotional neglect by both parents and emotional abuse when his mother was actively psychotic, he denied physical or sexual abuse. He denied any psychiatric history of mania, psychosis, or other past psychiatric symptoms, except as described above. He also specifically denied amnesia, blackouts, multiple identities, hallucinations, paranoia, and other unusual thoughts or experiences.Results of routine laboratory tests, a blood toxicology screen, and a physical examinationwere normal, as were a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan and an electroencephalogram. Consultations with an otorhinolaryngologist and a neurologist were noncontributory.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Depersonalization/derealization disorderSuggested ReadingsChoi KR, Seng JS, Briggs EC, et al: The dissociative subtype of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among adolescents: co-occurring PTSD, depersonalization/ derealization, and other dissociation symptoms.

Her family reported that Ms. Zayas reacted initially with inordinate calm.Concerned, relatives discreetly followed her around in their small apartment for several hours. She did not speak but instead engaged in repetitive, unnecessary tasks such as folding and unfolding clothes.That afternoon, standing at the washing machine, she had cried out, grabbed a bottle of bleach, and tried to drink from it. Her brother knocked it away. She fell to the ground, shaking, screaming, and crying. This episode lasted a few seconds, after which she \"lay as if dead\" for a few minutes. The family recalled no tonic-clonic movements, tongue biting, or loss of sphincter control. When the ambulance arrived, Ms. Zayas was crying softly, repeating the name of her fianc\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd, and was generally unresponsive to questions. After medical staff treated mild burns to her lips, she was triaged to the psychiatry department.Over the next few hours, Ms. Zayas became more responsive. During a clinical interview done in Spanish, she reported being struck \"numb\" (insensible) by the news of her fianc\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd's death and described a sense of being disconnected from her body, her emotions, and her surroundings. These symptoms were still present in the ER but diminished over several hours. She also described amnesia for what occurred from the moment when she cried out and her vision went \"dark\" (oscura), to when she \"awoke\" in the ER.While being kept under observation for 24 hours, Ms. Zayas had two more episodes of sudden agitation, crying, and screaming, during which she attempted to scratch her face and to leave the room. Because she responded quickly to verbal intervention and reassuring physical contact, she was not given medications or placed in restraints, but was kept on one-to-one observation. Her laboratory test results were unremarkable, as were an electroencephalogram and a lumbar puncture.On examination, she was crying softly, her mood was sad, and she said she did not remember making a suicide attempt. She was oriented to time, person, and place; had no psychotic symptoms; and denied current suicidal ideation.Ms. Zayas was transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit for evaluation. She initially had difficulty falling asleep and had sad, scary dreams about her fianc\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. She deniedrecalling anything from the hours after she tried to swallow bleach. She made efforts to avoid thinking about her fianc\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and was disturbed by intrusive recollections of their time together, but she never met DSM-5 criteria for acute stress disorder or major depressive disorder. Her symptoms had improved significantly after 1 week. She took no medications at the hospital and was discharged after 10 days with follow-up to outpatient care. She attended a single appointment 1 month later, at which point she and her family agreed that she was episodically sad about the death of her fianc\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd but essentially back to her normal self. At that point, she was lost to follow-up.", "diagnosis": "Diagnosis\" chapter in DSM-5-TR Section III has an entry on ataque de nervios, including the diagnoses potentially associated with this condition.Fear of this type of reaction presumably led the family to monitor Ms. Zayas closely after she received the news of her fianc\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd's murder, and helped prevent greater harm from the bleach. Ataques are very common, with a lifetime prevalence of about 10% in Puerto Ricans living in the United States. They are considered to be expected, even normal, reactions when precipitated by discrete and overwhelming stressors, such as in Ms.Zayas's case. A lifetime history of ataque is, however, associated with higher rates of mental health-related disability, suicidal ideation, and outpatient mental health care. Ms. Zayas's ataque, therefore, suggests potential vulnerability to psychiatric sequelae. In this particular case, Ms. Zayas and her family should be counseled that she may be at risk for another attack in the context of another stressor and would also be at risk for a delayed onset of posttraumatic stress disorder.The DSM-5-TR Core Cultural Formulation Interview, a standardized protocol for conducting an individual cultural assessment, can help clinicians understand Ms. Zayas's and her family's perspectives about the situation and facilitate development of anegotiated treatment plan.Diagnosis\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Other specified dissociative disorder (acute dissociative reactions to stressful events)Suggested ReadingsGuarnaccia PJ, Lewis-Fern\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdndez R, Mart\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnez Pincay I, et al: Ataque de nervios as a marker of social and psychiatric vulnerability: results from the NLAAS.

Levenson, M.D., Robert Boland, M.D., Jason P. Caplan, M.D., Theodore A. Stern, M.D., Joseph F.

Barnhill, M.D.Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is a DSM-5 diagnosis that describes a cluster of patients who have distressing somatic symptoms along with excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to these symptoms. SSD is an umbrella term intended to describe most of the patients who had previously held the diagnoses of somatization disorder, pain disorder, and hypochondriasis, which appeared in the DSM-IV chapter on somatoform disorders. A key difference is that diagnosing SSD requires a search for positive symptoms, such as distress and dysfunction, rather than a search for a negative (ruling out medically unexplained symptoms). Patients with SSD can-and often do- have physiologically based medical diagnoses, but the new diagnosis allows the clinician to focus on the distress and dysfunctional thoughts, feelings, and behaviors rather than the validity of patients' medical complaints.The DSM-5 chapter on somatic symptom and related disorders also includes illness anxiety disorder, functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder), psychological factors affecting other medical conditions (PFAOMC), and factitious disorder, as well as the \"other specified\" and \"unspecified\" somatic symptom and related disorder categories.For each of these disorders, the clinician should try to understand the patient's own perspective on the somatic experience, which is almost inevitably filtered through multiple lenses, including culture, health literacy, and previous health care experiences. When possible, DSM-5-TR text attempts to reduce the stigma and perceived criticism that can become part of a psychiatric diagnosis.For example, the term hypochondriasis was eliminated in DSM-5 because it was deemed pejorative and counterproductive to the development of a therapeutic alliance. It is also a term with a long, complex history that led to a broad spectrum of ideas about its meaning and etiology. DSM-5 divided hypochondriasis into two diagnostic clusters.Most people with DSM-IV hypochondriasis have significant health anxiety in the presence of significant somatic symptoms; in DSM-5, these people are described as having SSD. Perhaps 25% of individuals with elevated health anxiety lack significant somatic complaints; they are diagnosed with illness anxiety disorder (IAD), which was new in DSM-5.DSM-5 takes a similar approach to individuals who appear to have abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in the context of pain. Individuals who would have been diagnosed with a DSM-IV pain disorder generally fall under the DSM-5 SSD umbrella, with the specifier \"with predominant pain.\" Some people with abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to pain may be best conceptualized as having DSM-5 PFAOMC, a diagnosis that was previously included in the DSM-IV chapter \"Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention.\" PFAOMC refers to a condition in which psychological or behavioral factors adversely influence a medical condition. An example would be denial of the significance of chest pain, leading to delayed medical intervention for a myocardial infarction.The exploration of medically unexplained symptoms was deemphasized in DSM-5, andmost of the disorders in this chapter do not require that the clinician rule out physiologically based medical conditions. DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder (previously known as conversion disorder) is somewhat different. Its symptomatic criteria include altered voluntary motor or sensory function along with evidence that there is incompatibility between the symptom and recognized neurological or medical conditions. Specifiers for functional neurological symptom disorder can be used to describe symptoms (e.g., weakness or seizures), duration (e.g., acute or persistent), and the presence or absence of a relevant psychological stressor.Factitious disorder is the conscious production of false signs or symptoms. As with functional neurological symptom disorder, exploration of possible factitious disorder requires that the clinician consider the possibility that the patient's symptoms are not based on physiologically mediated illness. Such an approach need not be inevitably adversarial, and it is useful to balance the necessary skepticism with professional curiosity when the patient's presentation does not seem to be making sense.As seen throughout DSM-5, the chapter on somatic symptom and related disorders includes an \"unspecified\" category that is best used when symptoms are suggestive but information is limited. The \"other specified\" category is used when clinicians make a decision that an individual has characteristic features of a specific somatic symptom and related disorder and has significant distress and/or dysfunction but does not quite meet the stated criteria for that particular disorder. For example, a patient might meet all the criteria for SSD or IAD but have had symptoms for less than the required 6 months; the patient would then be noted to have brief SSD or brief IAD. The other two diagnoses within this other specified category are IAD without excessive health-related behaviors and pseudocyesis (i.e., false pregnancy).Anxiety and depressive disorders are each identified in about half of the somatic symptom and related disorders. Posttraumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder are also commonly identified in people with SSD. Identification of comorbidities can be crucial to the development of a strong alliance and a workable treatment plan.All of these disorders involve a prominent focus on physical concerns, and so it is notsurprising that they are most commonly found in medical rather than mental health care settings. These disorders are often accompanied by an unusual degree of clinical uncertainty, which can lead to a zealous search for the \"real\" cause of the problem. In general, DSM-5 encourages clinicians to focus on the patient rather than on the detection of falsehood. Although it may be useful to check a pregnancy test to detect pseudocyesis or an electroencephalogram during what appears to be a psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (previously called pseudoseizure), a skeptical search for \"the truth\" is often futile and can lead to mistrust, a fractured alliance, and termination of the treatment. Instead, DSM-5 encourages clinicians to apprehend the individual's relationship to the symptoms from cognitive, behavioral, and affective perspectives. In so doing, the clinician not only can develop an accurate and nonjudgmental understanding of the patient but also can begin the process of treatment.Suggested ReadingsBagayogo IP, Interian A, Escobar JI: Transcultural aspects of somatic symptoms in the context of depressive disorders.

A note sent ahead revealed that she had been tearful and frustrated at her last medical appointment, and her doctor, who had been struggling to control the patient's persistent back pain, felt that an evaluation by a psychiatrist might be helpful.Greeting Ms. Adams in the waiting room, the psychiatrist was struck by both her appearance and her manner: here was a woman with shaggy silver hair and dark sunglasses, seated in a wheelchair, who offered a limp handshake and a plaintive sigh before asking the psychiatrist if he would mind pushing her wheelchair into his office. She was tired from a long commute, and, she explained, \"Nobody on the street offered to help me out. Can you believe that?\"Once settled, Ms. Adams stated that she had been suffering from unbearable back pain for the previous 13 months. On the night \"that changed everything,\" she had locked herself out of her apartment and, while trying to climb in through a fire escape, had fallen and fractured her pelvis, coccyx, right elbow, and three ribs. Although she did not require surgery, she was bed-bound for 6 weeks and then underwent several months of physical therapy. Daily opioid medication had been only moderately helpful. She had seen \"a dozen\" doctors of various specialties and tried multiple treatments, including anesthetic injections and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, but her pain was unrelenting. Throughout this ordeal and for years previously, Ms. Adams smoked cannabis daily, explaining that a joint enjoyed in hourly puffs \"softened\" her pain and helped her to relax. She did not drink alcohol or use other illicit drugs.Prior to the accident, Ms. Adams had worked at a neighborhood salon for more than 20 years. She was proud to have had a large number of devoted clients, and she relished the camaraderie with her colleagues, whom she referred to as \"my real family.\" She had been unable to return to work since her accident on account of the pain. \"These doctors keep telling me I'm good to go back to work,\" she said with visible anger, \"but they don't know what I'm going through.\" Her voice broke. \"They don't believe me. They think I'm lying.\"She added that although friends had initially reached out after the accident, lately they had seemed less sympathetic. She let incoming telephone calls go to voice mail most ofthe time because she just did not feel up to socializing on account of the pain. In the previous month, she had stopped bathing daily and gotten slack about cleaning her apartment. Without the structure of work, she often found herself up until 5:00 a.m., and pain woke her several times before she finally got out of bed in the afternoon. As for her mood, she said, \"I'm so depressed it's ridiculous.\" She often felt hopeless of any possibility of living without pain but denied ever thinking of suicide. She explained that her Catholic faith prevented her from considering taking her own life.Ms. Adams had never seen a psychiatrist before and did not recall ever having felt depressed prior to her accident, although she described a \"hot temper\" as a family trait.

She had been generally healthy, other than binge eating and obesity, until a year earlier and had undergone gastric bypass surgery 6 years earlier.As she entered the consulting room, Ms. Balaban handed the psychiatrist a three-page summary of her physical concerns. Nocturnal leg spasms and daytime leg aches had been her initial concerns. She then developed sleep difficulties that led to \"brain fog\" and head heaviness. She had intermittent cold sensations in her extremities, face, ears, eyes, and nasal passages. Pulsating sensations in her eyes were, she thought, more pronounced after a poor night's sleep. In recent months, she had developed difficulty urinating, menstrual irregularity, and multiple muscle complaints, including right gluteal pain with a burning sensation into her right thigh. She also had neck stiffness with accompanying thoracic back spasms.Ms. Balaban's primary care physician had evaluated the initial symptoms and then referred her to a rheumatologist and a neurologist. The rheumatologist diagnosed mechanical back pain without evidence of inflammatory arthritis. She had also diagnosed possible migraines with peripheral neuropathic and ocular symptoms. The neurologist noted that Ms. Balaban was also being evaluated by a neurologist and a neuro-ophthalmologist at a nearby medical center. The other neurologist concluded her evaluation with a provisional diagnosis of \"atypical migraine variant,\" noting that \"thepatient seemed to also have a significant degree of depression, which might be aggravating the symptoms or even be an underlying precipitating factor.\" A review of tests done at the two medical centers indicated that Ms. Balaban had received the following essentially normal tests: two electroencephalograms, an electromyogram, three brain and three spinal magnetic resonance images, two lumbar puncture studies, and serial laboratory exams. Psychiatric consultation had been recommended, but the patient declined until repeatedly urged by her primary care physician.Ms. Balaban initially spoke to the psychiatrist primarily about her physical complaints. She was very frustrated that despite having seen several specialists, she had received no clear diagnosis, and she was still very concerned about her symptoms. She had started taking fluoxetine and gabapentin, prescribed by her primary care physician, and experienced partial improvement in her mood and some of her pains. She found it difficult to concentrate and complete her work and was spending a lot of time on the internet researching her symptoms. For the past several months, she had kept a spreadsheet that tried to link her symptoms to her blood pressure and pulse.She also felt bad about not spending enough time with her children or husband, but just did not have the energy. She acknowledged bouts of depressed mood over the prior year with some anhedonia and occasional thoughts of suicide (she had considered crashing her car), but no anorexia or guilt. She described having experienced premenstrual depressive symptoms for about a year.Ms. Balaban had been treated for postpartum depression 6 years earlier after the birth of her second child. Family history was significant for cancer, depression, and hypertension.Ms. Balaban lived with her husband and their daughters, ages 10 and 6 years. Her husband was being treated for depression.

He explained that he had been fatigued for a month and bedridden for a week. Then, saying he was too tired and confused to give much information, he asked the ER team to call his psychiatrist.The psychiatrist reported that he had treated Mr. Capek for more than two decades. He first saw Mr. Capek for a panic attack. It resolved with surprisingly small doses of clonazepam. After that, however, Mr. Capek continued to see him for help coping with his chronic illness. Initially a graduate student pursuing a master's degree in accounting, Mr. Capek dropped out of school over worries that the demands of his studies would exacerbate his disease. Since that time, his wife, a registered nurse, had been his primary support. He supplemented their income with small accounting jobs but limited these lest the stress affect his health.Mr. Capek usually felt physically and emotionally well. He deemed his occasional fatigue, anxiety, and concentration difficulties \"controllable\" and did not require treatment. Mr. Capek was typically averse to psychotropic medications and took a homeopathic approach to his disease, including exercise and proper nutrition. When his panicsymptoms would reemerge, he used small doses (e.g., one-quarter of a 0.5-mg lorazepam pill). His psychiatric sessions were commonly concerned about his underlying disease; he often brought articles on chronic Lyme disease for discussion and was active in a local Lyme disease support group.Mr. Capek's symptoms would occasionally worsen. However, these worsenings occurred less than yearly, and these \"exacerbations\" usually related to some apparent stress. The worst episode had been 1 year earlier, when his wife briefly left him following his revelation of an affair. Mr. Capek expressed shame about his behavior toward his wife- both the affair and his inability to support her. He subsequently cut off contact with the other woman and attempted to expand his accounting work. The psychiatrist speculated that similar stress was behind his current symptoms.The psychiatrist communicated regularly with Mr. Capek's internist. His Lyme disease tests had thus far been negative. When the internist reported this, Mr. Capek became defensive and produced literature on the inaccuracy of Lyme disease testing. Eventually, the internist and the psychiatrist agreed on a conservative treatment approach with a neutral stance regarding the disease's validity.On examination, Mr. Capek was a healthy, well-developed adult male. He was anxious and spoke quietly with his eyes closed. He frequently lost his train of thought, but with encouragement and patience, he could give a detailed history consistent with the psychiatrist's account. Physical examination findings were unremarkable, and a standard laboratory screen was normal except for a slightly low hemoglobin value. The medical team chose to defer further Lyme testing, given the patient's many past negative tests. However, on hearing about the low hemoglobin, Mr. Capek became alarmed, dismissed reassurances, and insisted that the team investigate this further.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Illness anxiety disorder, care-seeking type\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Panic disorderSuggested ReadingsRachman S: Health anxiety disorders: a cognitive construal.

Before she was taken to the emergency room (ER), emergency medical services administered several doses of lorazepam, with no change in her condition. On arrival at the ER, a loading dose of fosphenytoin was administered to her; it stopped the convulsive activity. Blood tests obtained in the ER revealed therapeutic levels of her usual antiepileptics and no evidence of any infection or metabolic disturbance. Urine toxicology screens were negative for the use of illicit substances. Ms. Delcampo was admitted to the neurology service for further monitoring.During her admission, a routine electroencephalogram (EEG) was ordered. Shortly after the study began, Ms. Delcampo began convulsing; this prompted administration of intravenous (IV) lorazepam. When the EEG was reviewed, no epileptiform activity was identified. Ms. Delcampo was placed on video-EEG (vEEG) monitoring, and her antiepileptics were tapered and discontinued. In the course of her monitoring, Ms.Delcampo had several episodes of convulsive motor activity; however, none was associated with epileptiform activity on the EEG. Psychiatric consultation was requested.On interview, Ms. Delcampo denied prior psychiatric evaluations, diagnoses, or treatments. She denied having depressed mood or any disturbance of sleep, energy, concentration, or appetite. She reported no thoughts of harming herself or others. She endorsed no signs or symptoms consistent with mania or psychosis. There was no family history of psychiatric illness or substance abuse. Her examination revealed a well- groomed woman, sitting on her hospital bed with EEG leads in place. She was pleasant and engaged, and she made good eye contact. Cognitive testing revealed no deficits.Ms. Delcampo noted that she had recently moved to the state to begin graduate school; she was excited about starting her studies and \"finally getting my career on track.\" She denied any recent specific psychosocial stressors other than her move and said, \"My lifeis finally where I want it to be.\" She was future oriented and concerned about the impact that her seizures might have on her long-term health. She was worried that a protracted hospitalization might cause her to miss the first day of classes (only a week away from the time of the interview). Moreover, she was quite concerned about the costs of her hospitalization because her health insurance coverage did not begin until the school semester commenced and the payment for extended benefits coverage from her previous employer would have a significant impact on her budget.When the findings of the vEEG study were discussed with Ms. Delcampo, she quickly became quite irritable, asking, \"So, everyone thinks I'm just making this up?\" She was not calmed by her treaters' attempts to clarify that they did not believe her to be faking her symptoms or by their reassurance that her symptoms might be helped by structured therapy.

She had been admitted through the emergency room for the latest flare-up of her underlying Crohn's disease. The consultation was called after the nurses became concerned that she was sad and lonely and was having a difficult time adjusting to her medical condition.Ms. Ehrlich was interviewed by the medical student on the psychiatry service. The patient indicated that the pain was excruciating and that she was neither sad nor lonely but was simply visiting from out of town, so no one knew she was even in the hospital. She told the medical student that her only previous therapy had been in college, when she went to student health services to get help for anxiety about test taking and her career choice. She had successfully completed a short course of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and the anxiety had not reappeared. She denied any other psychiatric history and had never taken psychiatric medication. In college, she studied psychology and worked part-time as a hospital orderly. Ms. Ehrlich had considered a career in medicine or nursing and asked the student how he had decided to go to medical school.Ms. Ehrlich reported that she had previously worked regularly and had \"quite a few friends,\" but that the recurrent abdominal pain had wrecked her social life and her job prospects. She had lost a job the year before because of absenteeism and had missed several job interviews due to her Crohn's flares. She had dated as a teenager but had been in no relationships since starting college. These things \"were not the end of theworld, but how would you feel?\" As a member of an online bowel disorders support group, Ms. Ehrlich e-mailed other members on a daily basis. She added that the only person in the family who \"got\" her was an aunt who also had Crohn's disease.The primary medical team was having difficulty obtaining collateral information from previous physicians, but the medical student was able to contact Ms. Ehrlich's mother. She did not know the exact names or phone numbers of her daughter's medical providers but did recall some of the hospitals and could recall, approximately, some of the physicians' names. She added that her daughter had not wanted her to be involved in her care and had not told her she was out of town, much less that she was in the hospital. She did say that the Crohn's disease had been diagnosed 2 years earlier, during her daughter's last semester of college. The mother estimated that Ms. Ehrlich had been hospitalized at least six times, in contrast with the daughter's report of two earlier hospitalizations. Neither the gastrointestinal (GI) team nor the medical student was able to locate Ms. Ehrlich's primary gastroenterologist, whose name the patient could spell only phonetically.On examination, Ms. Ehrlich was cooperative and conversant, and appeared comfortable. Her speech was fluent. She appeared calm and unworried about her upcoming procedures. Her thought process was linear. She denied paranoia, hallucinations, or suicidality. Attention and both recent and remote memory were intact. She acknowledged that it had been difficult living with Crohn's disease, but she was optimistic that her symptoms would improve. She denied depressive symptoms. She looked sad at the beginning of the interview, but she appeared more engaged and euthymic the more she talked. She could not explain why the team was unable to locate her doctor and became irritated when the medical student pressed more specifically to elicit further details about her prior care. She was taken to have an endoscopy and a colonoscopy at the end of the interview.Ms. Ehrlich's endoscopy and colonoscopy results were normal. That evening, the medical student from psychiatry sat in with the GI team as they reviewed the normal results with the patient. She said she was relieved there was no longer anything seriously wrong with her. The GI team told her that she could be discharged the next morning and that she should have her internist call them. She readily agreed.After the GI team left, Ms. Ehrlich told the student that she was \"feeling better already.\" She quickly removed her own intravenous line and started to get dressed. The student went to get the primary GI team. When they returned, the patient was gone.The medical student spent much of the next day calling hospitals and physicians that met descriptions provided by the patient and her mother. That afternoon, one of the physicians called back and indicated that he had treated Ms. Ehrlich 6 months earlier at a hospital near her mother's home.

On the fourth day of her hospitalization, the intensive care unit called a psychiatric consultation for \"noncompliance with treatment.\" The patient was refusing nebulizer treatments and noninvasive ventilation, and was consistently found to be hypoxic and hypercarbic. The patient told the psychiatrist that she could not tolerate wearing a mask on her face for nebulizer administration or ventilation because it made her \"really anxious\" and, she said, it caused her to feel more short of breath. She had been sleeping poorly and waking frequently with breathlessness and panic. She described feeling worried that she was getting sicker the longer she stayed in the hospital and she wanted to go home. When she asked her providers for help, she reported, all they would do was ask her to \"put her mask back on.\"In gathering a history, the consultant learned that Ms. Fredholm had grown up with her parents and two older healthy siblings in a town outside of the large city where this hospital was located. Her mother, originally from Puerto Rico, was a school nurse, and had taken on primary responsibility for Ms. Fredholm's medical care, including administering her daily pulmonary treatments. She referred to this, when Ms. Fredholm was a child, as their \"playtime\"; she would sing songs and tell her stories.

Feeding and Eating Disorders? Full AccessEdited by:John W. Barnhill, M.D., Susan Samuels, M.D., Eve K. Freidl, M.D., Evelyn Attia, M.D., Jennifer J. Thomas, Ph.D., Anne E. Becker, M.D., Ph.D., James E. Mitchell, M.D., Susan L. McElroy, M.D.https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9781615375295.jb10IntroductionJohn W. Barnhill, M.D.Until the publication of DSM-5, half of the people in eating disorder specialty clinics did not meet criteria for either of the two specific eating disorder categories-anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa-and instead received the nonspecific diagnosis of eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS). This percentage swelled even further in general psychiatric outpatient settings. A large percentage of patients with impairment and distress related to eating problems were left, therefore, without a diagnosis that specifically described their condition.DSM-5 made multiple changes to help subdivide the eating disorder population into coherent and evidence-based subgroups. For example, binge-eating disorder (BED) was moved out of DSM-IV Appendix B (\"Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study\") and into the main body of the DSM-5 text. The criteria for anorexia nervosa (AN) remained conceptually unchanged but were expanded in two ways. First, the requirement for amenorrhea was eliminated. Second, a previous core AN criterion, theexpressed fear of weight gain, is not always present in people who appear to display robust symptoms of AN; in order to remedy this quandary, DSM-5 added an alternative to the \"expressed fear\" criterion: the individual may manifest persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain. This alternative criterion allows the diagnosis of people whose behavior is indicative of AN but who have impaired insight, suboptimal levels of cooperation or transparency, or alternative rationales for food restriction. Bulimia nervosa (BN) also stayed conceptually the same in DSM-5, but the threshold for diagnosis was lowered by reducing the frequency of binge eating and compensatory behavior from twice to once weekly.The diagnosis avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) was introduced in DSM-5 to describe people who restrict or avoid food in a way that leads to significant impairment but who do not meet criteria for AN. A broad and inclusive category, ARFID includes individuals who previously met criteria for the DSM-IV diagnosis feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood. ARFID describes a cluster of patients who are generally children and adolescents but who can be any age.By adding BED to the main text, reducing the threshold for a diagnosis of AN and BN, and creating the ARFID diagnosis, DSM-5 intended to more clearly describe subpopulations of patients who would previously have been recognized as having an eating disorder causing impairment but would have been characterized within the uninformative category of EDNOS. Furthermore, evidence indicates that individuals who meet the more flexible criteria are, in meaningful ways, similar to those who meet the older criteria. Controversy centers on whether this expansion of the criteria for eating disorder diagnoses might \"pathologize\" people who do not have actual problems with eating. As is the case throughout DSM-5, diagnostic criteria require the presence of significant distress and/or impairment. Individuals within a normal range of eating behaviors should not receive a diagnosis.Many patients with clinically relevant eating problems do not meet full criteria for a specific eating disorder. For example, an individual may meet all criteria for AN- including significant weight loss-but remain at a normal or above-normal weight. Such a presentation would warrant a diagnosis of specific eating disorder (atypical anorexia nervosa). Other specific eating disorders include bulimia or binge eating of lowfrequency or duration; purging without binge eating; and night eating syndrome. Finally, the diagnosis \"unspecified feeding or eating disorder\" is intended to describe individuals who have an apparent eating disorder but do not meet full criteria for a specific disorder, perhaps because of an inadequate amount of confirmatory information (e.g., in an emergency room setting).Pica refers to the persistent, clinically significant eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances. Pica is often identified in adults with intellectual development disorder as well as in typically developing children. Worldwide surveys indicate that 30% of pregnant women ingest nonnutritive substances such as ice and clay; food insecurity and vitamin deficiency appear to increase the risk for pica in these pregnant women.Rumination disorder refers to the recurrent regurgitation of food, which can be seen in infants as well as throughout the life cycle. Pica and rumination disorder can be diagnosed with comorbid psychiatric conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, intellectual developmental disorder, and schizophrenia, as long as the eating disorder reaches a threshold of clinical significance.Notably, DSM-5 clarifies a hierarchy of diagnoses so that only a single feeding or eating disorder diagnosis can be made for any particular individual (with the exception that pica can be comorbid with any other feeding or eating disorder). The overall eating disorder hierarchy is AN, BN, ARFID, BED, and rumination disorder. In other words, anorexia nervosa takes precedence over the others, and if AN is diagnosed, the individual cannot also have, for example, binge-eating disorder.Suggested ReadingsFawcett EJ, Fawcett JM, Mazmanian D: A meta-analysis of the worldwide prevalence of pica during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

His parents reported that he had developed constipation, with only one bowel movement in the past week, and that he had vomited earlier in the day. Teachers at his special education classroom for children with intellectual developmental disorders had written a report earlier in the week indicating that Thomas had been having difficulties since soon after transferring from a similar school in a different state about 4 months earlier. The teachers and parents agreed that Thomas often looked distressed, rocking, crying, and clutching his stomach.One week earlier, a pediatrician had diagnosed an acute exacerbation of chronic constipation. Use of a recommended over-the-counter laxative was not helpful, and Thomas began to complain of nighttime pain. The discomfort led to a diminished interest in his favorite hobbies, which were video games and sports. Instead, he tended to stay in his room, playing with army men figurines that he had inherited from his grandfather's collection. Aside from episodes of irritability and tearfulness, he was generally doing well in school, both in the classroom and on the playground. When not complaining of stomachaches, Thomas ate well and maintained his position at about the 40th percentile for height and weight on the growth curve.Thomas's past medical history was significant for constipation and stomachaches, as well as for intermittent headaches. All of these symptoms had worsened several months earlier, after the family moved from a house in semirural Florida into an old walk-up apartment in a large urban city in a different state. He shared a room with his younger brother (age 6 years), the product of a normal, unexpected pregnancy, who was enrolled in a regular education class at the local public school. Thomas said his brother was his\"best friend.\" Thomas was adopted at birth, and nothing was known of his biological parents except that they were teenagers unable to care for the child.On medical examination in the ER, Thomas was a well-groomed boy sitting on his mother's lap. He was crying and irritable and refused to speak to the examiner. Instead, he would repeat to his parents that his stomach hurt. On physical examination, he was afebrile and had stable vital signs. His physical examination was remarkable only for general abdominal tenderness, although he was difficult to assess because he cried uncontrollably through most of the exam.An abdominal X ray revealed multiple small metallic particles throughout the gastrointestinal tract, initially suspected to be ingested high-lead paint flakes, as well as three 2-centimeter-long metallic objects in his stomach. A blood lead level was 20 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdg/dL (whereas normal level for children is < 5 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdg/dL). More specific questioning revealed that Thomas, being constipated, often spent long stretches on the toilet by himself. His parents added that although the bathroom was in the process of being renovated, its paint was old and peeling. Consultants decided that the larger foreign bodies in the stomach might not safely pass and could be accounting for the constipation. Endoscopy successfully extricated three antique toy soldiers from Thomas's stomach.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nPica\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\n Intellectual developmental disorder, mild to moderate\nSuggested ReadingsSamsel CB, Walter HJ, DeMaso DR: Rumination and pica, in Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st Edition.

The psychiatrist had been treating Uma for perfectionistic traits that caused her significant anxiety. Their sessions focused on anxiety, not on eating behavior.Uma's eating difficulties started at age 9, when she began refusing to eat and reporting a fear that she would vomit. At that time, her parents sought treatment from a pediatrician, who continued to evaluate her yearly, explaining that it was normal for children to go through phases. At age 9, Uma was above the 25th percentile for both height and weight (52 inches, 58 pounds), but by age 11, she had essentially stopped growing and had dropped to the 5th percentile on her growth curves (52.5 inches, 55 pounds).The only child of two professional parents who had divorced 5 years earlier, Uma lived with her mother on weekdays and with her nearby father on weekends. Her medical history was significant for her premature birth at 34 weeks' gestation. She was slow to achieve her initial milestones but by age 2 was developmentally normal. Yearly physical examinations had been unremarkable with the exception of the recent decline of her growth trajectory. Uma had always been petite, but her height and weight had never fallen below the 25th percentile for stature and weight for age on the growth chart. Uma was a talented student who was well liked by her teachers. She had never had more than a few friends, but recently she had stopped socializing entirely and had been coming directly home after school, reporting that her stomach felt calmer when she was in her own home.For the prior 2 years, Uma had eaten only very small amounts of food over very long durations of time. Her parents had tried to pique her interest by experimenting with foods from different cultures and of different colors and textures. None of this seemed effective in improving her appetite. They also tried to let her pick restaurants to try, but Uma had gradually refused to eat outside of either parent's home. Both parents reported a similar mealtime pattern: Uma would agree to sit at the table but then spent her time rearranging food on her plate, cutting food items into small pieces, and crying if urged to eat another bite.When asked more about her fear of vomiting, Uma remembered one incident, at age 4, when she ate soup and her stomach became upset and then she subsequently vomited. More recently, Uma had developed fear of eating in public and ate no food during the school day. She denied any concerns about her appearance and said that she had first become aware of her low weight at her most recent visit to the pediatrician. When educated about the dangers of low body weight, Uma became tearful and expressed a clear desire to gain weight.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder\nSuggested ReadingsBryant-Waugh R, Markham L, Kreipe RE, Walsh BT: Feeding and eating disorders in childhood.

She presented toher primary care physician complaining of frequent headaches and chronic fatigue. Her physical examination was unremarkable except that her weight was only 78 pounds and her height was 5 feet 1 inch, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 14.7 kg/m2. Ms.Gaspard also reported having missed two menstrual periods in the past 6 months. Unable to find a medical explanation for Ms. Gaspard's symptoms and concerned about her extremely low weight, the physician referred Ms. Gaspard to the hospital eating disorders program.On presentation for psychiatric evaluation, Ms. Gaspard was cooperative and pleasant. She expressed concern about her low weight and denied fear of weight gain or body image disturbance: \"I know I need to gain weight. I'm too skinny,\" she said. Ms. Gaspard reported that she had weighed 98 pounds prior to moving to the United States 1 year earlier and said she felt \"embarrassed\" when her family members and even strangers told her she had grown too thin. Notably, everyone else in her U.S.-dwelling extended family was either of normal weight or overweight.Despite her stated motivation to be at a healthy weight, Ms. Gaspard's dietary recall revealed that she was consuming only 600 calories per day. The day before the evaluation, for example, she had eaten only a small bowl of macaroni pasta, a plate of steamed broccoli, and a cup of black beans. Her fluid intake was also quite limited, typically consisting of only two or three glasses of water daily.Ms. Gaspard provided multiple reasons for her poor intake. The first was lack of appetite: \"My brain doesn't even signal that I'm hungry,\" she said. \"I have no desire to eat throughout the whole day.\" The second was postprandial bloating and nausea: \"I just feel so uncomfortable after eating.\" The third was the limited choice of foods permitted by her religion, which advocates a vegetarian diet. \"My body is not really my own. It is a temple of God,\" she explained. The fourth reason was that her preferred sources of vegetarian protein (e.g., tofu, processed meat substitutes) were not affordable within her limited household budget. Ms. Gaspard had not completed high school and had a minimum-wage position, working part-time at a clerical job at her church.Ms. Gaspard denied any other symptoms of disordered eating, including binge eating, purging, or other behaviors intended to promote weight loss. However, in regard toexercise, she reported that she walked for approximately 3-4 hours per day. She denied that her activity was motivated by a desire to burn calories. Instead, Ms. Gaspard stated that because she did not have a car and disliked waiting for the bus, she traveled on foot to all work and leisure activities.Ms. Gaspard reported no other notable psychiatric symptoms apart from the history of inadequate food intake and excessive physical activity. She appeared euthymic and did not report any symptoms of depression. She denied using alcohol or illicit drugs. She noted that her concentration was poor but expressed hope that a herbal supplement she had just begun taking would improve her memory.

She added that she had gone to her internist several times in recent months for stomachaches, and he finally insisted that she see a psychiatrist.Ms. Hoffman had been living alone since her college graduation 2 years earlier. She had recently been promoted in her job as an accountant, and said that she enjoyed her work. She mentioned having some friends from high school and being interested in dating, but she felt too tired and sad to do much besides meet up for a quick dinner after work. She was unable to exercise because of low energy, slept poorly, and frequently had stomachaches. These symptoms and the resulting social dysfunction had caused her to feel increasingly isolated, lonely, and sad. She often found herself feeling worthless and wondering how she was going to get through the week, but she denied suicidal intent or plan.She said she had accepted the psychiatric referral so that she could get an antidepressant medication, but \"it had to be one that didn't cause weight gain.

She said her downfall really began when she started \"stress eating\" in college. When she realized she had gained 10 or 15 pounds, she began to routinely skip breakfast. She often skipped lunch as well, but then, famished, she would overeat in the late afternoon and evening.By the end of her sophomore year, Ms. Hoffman had started inducing vomiting, apractice she learned about in a magazine. She had developed her current eating pattern during her junior year and continued it after graduation: no breakfast; a \"light\" lunch; an \"average\" dinner, often with friends; and then she'd rush back to her apartment for a second dinner and a pint or two of ice cream, followed by self-induced vomiting.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nBulimia nervosa\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nMajor depressive disorder\n\nSuggested ReadingsMason TB, Lesser EL, Dolgon-Krutolow AR, et al: An updated transdiagnostic review of social cognition and eating disorder psychopathology.

She was at her \"highest weight ever,\" which was 140 pounds (her height was 5 feet 5 inches, so her BMI was 23.3).The psychiatrist embarked on a clarification of Ms. Isherwood's eating history, which was marked by recurrent, distressing episodes of uncontrollable eating of large amounts of food. The overeating was not new but seemed to have worsened while she was taking antidepressants. She reported that she often worked late in her job as marketing director for a large software company, and that the eating episodes often occurred on one of 2 days per week that she happened to get home before her husband, a cardiologist at a local hospital. These \"eating jags\" were notable for a sense that she was out of control.She ate rapidly and alone, until uncomfortably full. She would then feel depressed, tired, and disgusted with herself.

Barnhill, M.D.The chapter on elimination disorders is the second of four consecutive DSM-5 chapters that explicitly deal with variations of normal bodily processes. These normal bodily processes can go awry in multiple ways, but from a diagnostic perspective, the distress and/or dysfunction can emerge as a symptomatic part of another disorder or as a relatively autonomous elimination disorder (with or without comorbidities).Enuresis and encopresis are the two primary elimination disorders. Each is subdivided in ways that are both logical and clinically relevant. The diagnostic criteria for each disorder specify the developmental age at which the diagnosis becomes applicable. For example, enuresis-the repeated voiding of urine into bed and clothes-is not a diagnosis until the child has reached a developmental age of 5 years. A significant number of younger children simply are not yet ready to reliably use the bathroom.DSM-5 does not require that the clinician ascertain the degree to which voluntary control plays a role; for example, a psychiatric diagnosis of nighttime bed-wetting(nocturnal enuresis) need not depend on whether the parent indicates that \"he is doing it for attention.\" Similarly, a young boy who refuses to defecate in the bathroom at school and then is regularly and embarrassingly incontinent warrants a diagnosis (encopresis with constipation and overflow incontinence) that does not demand that the clinician delve deeply into the child's views on kindergarten, separation, and bodily control. The clinician may choose to make those assessments, but the diagnostic process does not require such a pursuit.Instead, the focus is on more readily ascertainable measures. Is the enuresis clinically significant? Is it persistent? Is it causing distress? DSM-5 also encourages the clinician to make an effort to evaluate for physiological causes of enuresis and encopresis, because such common and readily treatable conditions as a urinary tract infection or dehydration can cause highly upsetting symptoms.Abnormalities of elimination are also seen as secondary to many medical and nonmedical psychiatric conditions. The link between depression and constipation is common, for example, as is the link between gastrointestinal distress and a wide range of medications. These comorbidities should be actively considered. At the same time, it is important to tactfully consider whether an autonomous elimination disorder should be the focus of clinical attention.Suggested ReadingsIrwin GM: Urinary incontinence.

The mother reported that the symptoms appeared related to the nights that he spent with his aunt, another single mom with a boy similar in age to Zack. He had been close to this aunt since birth but had only recently begun to spend every Friday night with her when the mother took on a night shift at work.For 2 months prior to the consultation, Zack would report nausea and headaches on Fridays and complain that his aunt's house was \"creepy.\" He continued to visit, with reluctance, although he did once call his mother at work demanding that she pick him up, saying, \"Other kids live in their own home every day of the week.\"In recent weeks, Zack screamed and hid when it came time to go to his aunt's home. His mother became concerned that something could have \"happened\" to Zack during a visit. The mother struggled to reconcile this with the fact that Zack had no objections to seeing the aunt and cousin anywhere else, and he had no objection to the cousin sleeping at their home. Her sister had always been \"a good mom\" and was always home during the sleepovers. She did have a boyfriend, but Zack seemed to like him. In fact, Zack seemed especially excited to go to the park or ball games with his cousin and the boyfriend.Zack had never previously had particularly significant separation, behavioral, or emotional issues. He achieved all developmental milestones on time. He had never seen a doctor aside from routine visits and one bad cold when he was age 3. Zack had yet to achieve consistent overnight continence, however, and did wet the bed approximately twice weekly. He had no daytime voiding symptoms or constipation. The pediatrician had told them that this was \"normal\" at Zack's age. The mother had never made a big deal about the bed-wetting, and Zack had never expressed significant distress about it.Family history was negative for all psychiatric illness on the mother's side, and the mother said her own developmental landmarks were normal as far as she had been told. The mother knew little about Zack's father's developmental or family history, and she had not seen him since before Zack was born.On mental status examination, Zack was cooperative and appeared well nourished and well cared for. He had little difficulty separating from his mother. After an initial periodof warming up to the interviewer, his speech was spontaneous with a vocabulary appropriate for his age. He maintained age-appropriate eye contact. His affect was initially mildly anxious, but he rapidly calmed. Anxiety only reappeared upon discussing his sleepovers, when Zack demonstrated some fidgeting, decreased eye contact, and mild irritability directed toward his mother. When asked about the bed-wetting, Zack appeared embarrassed. He said he had wet the bed at his aunt's house a few times and that both his cousin and his aunt's boyfriend teased him about it. His aunt had intervened, but he described being \"scared\" that he would do it again.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \n\nEnuresis, nocturnal only\n\nSuggested ReadingsHussong J, Rosenthal A, Bernhardt A, et al: State and trait anxiety in children with incontinence and their parents.

Sleep-Wake Disorders? Full AccessEdited by:John W. Barnhill, M.D., Charles F. Reynolds, M.D., Maurice M. Ohayon, M.D., D.Sc., Ph.D., Brian Palen, M.D., Vishesh K. Kapur, M.D., M.P.H., Kathy P. Parker, Ph.D., R.N.https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9781615375295.jb12IntroductionJohn W. Barnhill, M.D.The pursuit of restful sleep is bedeviled by work and family pressures, long-distance travel, and the ubiquitous presence of stimulants (e.g., coffee) and electronics (e.g., e- mail). A good night's sleep can be a casualty of a host of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, and bipolar and psychotic disorders, as well as a variety of nonpsychiatric medical conditions. Sleep problems may not simply be epiphenomena but can precipitate, prolong, and intensify these other psychiatric and medical conditions. All too often, however, sleep-wake disorders exist as silent and undiagnosed contributors to distress and dysfunction.DSM-5 made use of both a \"lumping\" and a \"splitting\" approach to the sleep disorders, thus moving away from making causal attributions (e.g., depression inevitably causes insomnia) and instead acknowledging the bidirectional interactions between sleep and other disorders. Insomnia disorder can exist autonomously, but clinicians are encouraged to consider insomnia's frequent comorbidity with both psychiatric andnonpsychiatric medical conditions. Clarification of an independent sleep disorder can serve as a reminder to the clinician that the sleep problem may not resolve spontaneously but instead may warrant independent psychiatric attention.In addition to a broad clinical approach, DSM-5 features sleep disorders that require very specific physiological findings. For example, a patient may present with restless sleep and daytime fatigue. If the patient's bed partner identifies unusually loud snoring, sleep apnea would likely be considered. A DSM-5 diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea requires not only clinical evidence but also a polysomnogram that reveals at least five obstructive apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep (or, if there is no evidence of nocturnal breathing difficulties, 15 or more such apneic events per hour).Advances in epidemiological, neurobiological, and interventions research have allowed some sleep disorders to be increasingly \"split.\" For example, narcolepsy is defined by two required criteria. The first is clinical: the patient must experience recurrent, persistent episodes marked by irrepressible sleep or an irrepressible need for sleep. The second criterion can be met in three ways: by recurrent episodes of cataplexy (defined clinically); hypocretin deficiency (defined via cerebrospinal fluid levels obtained through lumbar puncture); or specifically abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency as determined by nocturnal sleep polysomnography or a multiple sleep latency test. These results led to four separately coded subtypes of DSM-5-TR narcolepsy: 1) with cataplexy or hypocretin deficiency (type 1), 2) without cataplexy and either without hypocretin deficiency or hypocretin unmeasured (type 2), 3) with cataplexy or hypocretin deficiency due to a medical condition, and 4) without cataplexy and without hypocretin deficiency due to a medical condition.REM sleep behavior disorder and restless legs syndrome were new disorders in DSM-5. For each, substantial evidence had clarified the physiological basis, prevalence, and clinical relevance. Both are often comorbid with other psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medical conditions (e.g., REM sleep behavior disorder is often comorbid with narcolepsy and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease; restless legs syndrome is often comorbid with depression, cardiovascular disease, and end-stage renal disease).The initial sleep assessment generally involves a retrospective patient report. Cliniciansare accustomed to working with subjective reports, but a sleep complaint that is impossible (\"I haven't slept in weeks\") can lead the clinician to think \"insomnia\" and move on with other aspects of the evaluation. Increasingly robust diagnostic criteria for the sleep-wake disorders are helpful for a variety of reasons, but they are especially helpful as a reminder to the general clinician to explore common complaints that are often underdiagnosed and that contribute to significant distress and dysfunction.Suggested ReadingsAmerican Academy of Sleep Medicine: International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition (ICSD-3).

The trouble began 4 months earlier, when he started to wake up at 3:00 every morning, no matter when he went to bed, and then was unable to fall back to sleep. As a result, he felt \"out of it\" during the day. This led him to feelincreasingly worried about how he was going to finish his doctoral dissertation when he was unable to concentrate owing to exhaustion. When his sleep difficulties began, he woke with nothing particular on his mind. As the trouble persisted, he found himself dreading the upcoming day and wondering how he would teach his classes or focus on his writing if he was getting only a few hours of sleep. Some mornings he lay awake in the dark next to his fianc\u00ef\u00bf\u00bde, who was sleeping soundly. On other mornings he would cut his losses, rise from bed, and go very early to his office on campus.After a month of interrupted sleep, Mr. Johns visited a physician's assistant at the university's student health services, where he customarily got his medical care. (He suffered from asthma, for which he occasionally took inhaled \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd2-adrenergic receptor agonists, and a year earlier he had had mononucleosis.) The physician's assistant prescribed a sedative-hypnotic, which did not help. \"Falling asleep was never the problem,\" Mr. Johns explained. Meanwhile, he heeded some of the advice he read online. Although he felt reliant on coffee during the day, he never drank it after 2:00p.m. An avid tennis player, he restricted his court time to the early morning. He did have a glass or two of wine every night at dinner with his fianc\u00ef\u00bf\u00bde, however. \"By dinnertime I start to worry about whether I'll be able to sleep,\" he said, \"and, to be honest, the wine helps.\"The patient, a slender and fit-appearing young man looking very much the part of the young academic in a tweed jacket and tortoise-rimmed glasses, was pleasant and open in his storytelling. Mr. Johns did not appear tired but told the evaluating psychiatrist, \"I made a point to see you in the morning, before I hit the wall.\" He did not look sad or on edge and was not sure if he had ever felt depressed.

She was living with a new companion. Ms. Kleber presented to a psychiatrist for anxiety and sleepiness.Ms. Kleber had experienced anxiety much of her life, but she had become much more worried and stressed since the birth of her first child 10 years before. She said she was \"okay at home\" but anxious in social situations. She avoided having to interact with new people, fearing that she would be embarrassed and judged. For example, she wanted to lose the weight that she had gained since the births of her children (current body mass index [BMI] 27.7) but was afraid of the ridicule that might accompany her efforts at the gym. She had gradually withdrawn from situations in which she might be forced to meet new people, and this made it almost impossible for her to interview for a new job, much less work in one. She had been successfully treated for social anxiety disorder 5 years earlier with psychotherapy, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] antidepressant, and clonazepam 0.25 mg twice daily, but her symptoms had returned over the prior year. She denied increasing the dose of either medication or taking any other medication (prescribed or over the counter) for anxiety. Although excited abouther new relationship, she was worried her new girlfriend would leave her if she did not \"tune up my act.\"She denied periods of significant depression, although she said she had experienced multiple periods of feeling frustrated with her limited effectiveness. She also denied all manic symptoms.The psychiatrist then asked Ms. Kleber about her \"sleepiness.\" She said she slept more than anyone she knew. She said she typically slept at least 9 hours per night but then took two naps for 5 additional hours during the day. She did not recall a problem until the end of high school, when she started falling asleep around 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. and dozing every afternoon. When she tried to go to college, she realized how much more sleep she needed than her friends and eventually dropped out because she could not stay awake in class. Despite the naps, she typically fell asleep when visiting friends or family and when reading or watching TV. She quit driving alone for fear of falling asleep at the wheel. Late afternoon naps were not restorative and had no apparent impact on her falling asleep at night.Raising a family was difficult, especially because mornings were Ms. Kleber's worst period. For at least half an hour after waking, she was disoriented and confused, making it difficult to get her children to school. Throughout the day, she said she felt \"scattered and inattentive.\"Snoring had appeared 5 years earlier. Her companion was unsure whether Ms. Kleber also had breathing pauses during her sleep. Ms. Kleber denied having ever experienced sleep paralysis or abruptly falling asleep in the middle of a sentence. Although she would fall asleep while socializing, it would generally occur during a lull in the conversation while she was in a quiet spot in the corner of a couch. She denied falling down when she fell asleep. She reported experiencing hypnopompic hallucinations several times per year since she was a teenager.On examination, Ms. Kleber was an overweight woman who was cooperative and coherent. She was concerned about her anxiety but preoccupied with her sleep problem. She denied depression, suicidality, psychosis, and memory complaints. Her insight and judgment appeared intact.Her physical examination was essentially noncontributory. Her medical history was significant only for hypercholesterolemia and occasional migraine headaches. Ms. Kleber did have some muscular complaints, such as weakness in her legs and pain in her left arm; these were related to exertion. She has smoked marijuana occasionally to help with her pain but denied that the marijuana was an important contributor to her sleepiness.She denied a history of head trauma and unusual illnesses. She denied a family history of sleep or mood problems, although multiple relatives were \"anxious.\"Ms. Kleber was referred for sleep studies.

Barnhill, M.D.Although the criteria for the sexual disorders are relatively straightforward, they hint at the challenge of categorizing sexual problems. For example, a diagnostic system that intends to meaningfully describe sexual dysfunction must take into consideration the broad range of normal sexual response. The system must take into account the fact that dysfunction and distress depend heavily on the individual's expectations, wishes, and opportunities regarding sexual activity (as well as those of his or her partner). It should consider the effects of aging. It should consider the effects of proscriptive societal and religious norms on sexual behavior as well as take into account what it means to sexually function as a man or woman (or elsewhere on the modern gender continuum). The system should also take into account medications and illnesses that predictably reduce sexual desire and/or function, as well as those that predictably intensify desire and/or function, in addition to the reality that most assessments of sexual function and dysfunction are incomplete without an understanding that although sexual response has a biological underpinning, it is experienced from intrapersonal, interpersonal, and cultural perspectives.In that biopsychosocial context, making a diagnosis of, for example, male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is potentially more complicated than briefly exploring whether the patient is interested in having sex.DSM-5 identifies eight sexual dysfunctions, four specific to men, three specific to women, and one that can apply to either gender (substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction). DSM-5 terminology and criteria vary somewhat between the genders. For example, men may have erectile disorder and/or male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, but for women, the somewhat comparable condition is merged into female sexual interest/arousal disorder.DSM-5-TR addresses the fact that both men and women can have difficulties with orgasm. Whereas women may meet criteria for female orgasmic disorder, men may be diagnosed with either delayed ejaculation or premature (early) ejaculation. Women can also have genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, a diagnosis that is new to DSM-5 and that was developed in response to the increasing recognition that the prior diagnoses of vaginismus and dyspareunia were highly comorbid and difficult to distinguish. In addition, as is generally the case in DSM-5, there are categories for clinical presentations that either do not quite meet criteria or are incomplete (i.e., other specified or unspecified sexual dysfunction).Except for substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction, all of the sexual dysfunctions require a minimum duration of 6 months. In addition, each disorder can be noted to be lifelong versus acquired and generalized versus situational. If a medical condition is deemed pertinent, it can be listed as a specifier, but DSM-5 has specifically excluded the previous diagnosis of sexual dysfunction due to a medical condition because of the view that most of the sexual dysfunctions can be attributable to both psychological and biological factors.The sexual dysfunction diagnoses are applicable to gender-diverse individuals. In particular, DSM-5-TR encourages clinician judgment when assessing sexual dysfunctions among transgender, nonbinary, agender, and other individuals who may not appear to fit this chapter's categories. When the diagnosis is based on anatomy (e.g., erectile dysfunction), DSM-5-TR guides the clinician to base the diagnosis on theperson's current anatomy rather than on the sex assigned at birth.Suggested ReadingsBalon R, Briken P (eds): Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder: Understanding, Assessment, and Treatment.

They were both successful attorneys in their late 30s. They had known each other since high school, had been dating for about 2 years, and planned to get married in about 6 months. Both denied ever having previously seen a therapist or received a psychiatric diagnosis.The couples therapist met with them together for one session. Both Ms. Olsen and Mr. Nelson reported being very much in love and wanting the marriage to work out, but they also said that they were fighting much of the time. Ms. Olsen said she admired Mr.Nelson's intelligence and steadiness and did not know why they fought. He, on the other hand, said he was still \"totally infatuated\" but upset about Ms. Olsen's overall lack of interest in him. As the session neared a close, Mr. Nelson asked Ms. Olsen whether she wanted to bring up \"the schedule, the alcohol, or the sex thing,\" at which she smiled and said, \"I'm afraid we're out of time for today.\"The therapist met with each of them separately. At his meeting, Mr. Nelson said his biggest concern with Ms. Olsen was her lack of interest in sex. She seemed to go through the motions, he said, and always relied on alcohol. He worried that he was a \"7 trying to date a 10\" and that she just did not find him attractive. He was distressed about the fact that, try as he might, he was unable to bring her to orgasm or even to get hersignificantly aroused. This was, in turn, leading him to initiate sex less frequently, and even when he tried, he would \"often just give up half-way through.\" He had brought it up with her several times, but she had insisted that there was no problem. The therapist asked what he had meant by \"the schedule thing.\" He explained that since they had begun dating, she had limited their time together to one \"school night,\" usually a Tuesday, and then either a Friday or Saturday night. She had insisted that the schedule was necessary for her to complete her work and see her best girlfriends, but he had increasingly come to believe it was to avoid him.In her individual session, Ms. Olsen said she was most frustrated by Mr. Nelson's intensity and high desire for sex. She had set up their weekly schedule because otherwise he would want to constantly have sex with her. As it was, he wanted sex every time they got together, often twice in the same night. She readily admitted that she got drunk to tolerate intercourse. She added that she had used alcohol to numb herself since she began dating while in her teens. Until she had started dating Mr. Nelson, most of her sexual experiences had been \"while drunk with strangers.\" She had had a couple of boyfriends, but one was secretly gay and the other was \"happy to get a blow job every now and then.\" She had not told Mr. Nelson about these misadventures because she preferred that he continue to see her as \"the near-virginal beauty queen.\" Although alcohol made intercourse acceptable, \"sexual arousal was almost never tolerable\" and made her want to pass out. In recent months, Mr. Nelson had increasingly \"forced the orgasm issue.\" In the past, she would simply have broken up with any boyfriend who acted that way, but she believed she needed to stick it out because she was nearing 40 and this would be her \"last chance to have a baby.\" When asked why she thought she had these issues with sex, Ms. Olsen looked out the window for almost a minute and then answered, \"I'm not going to tell you.\"", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nFemale sexual interest/arousal disorder\n\nSuggested ReadingsBancroft J: Human Sexuality and Its Problems, 3rd Edition.

Barnhill, M.D.Psychiatrists study, categorize, and treat all manners of mental illness. Although there is a fringe perspective that all mental illness is \"myth,\" almost no one within psychiatry doubts the distress and dysfunction that accompany such mental illnesses as schizophrenia, psychotic depression, and bipolar mania. There is more debate, however, about symptom clusters that blend subtly into variations on normal. When is shyness an anxiety disorder? When does quirkiness become high-functioning autism spectrum disorder? At what point do disagreeable behaviors become a personality disorder? When do \"senior moments\" become mild neurocognitive disorder? These debates are inevitable and are akin to similar debates about such nonpsychiatric medical diagnoses as diabetes and hypertension.Definitions of normalcy directly affect psychiatric research funding and clinical insurance coverage, and they affect how society views atypical feelings, behaviors, and thoughts. To deal with this issue, DSM-5-TR focuses heavily on distress and dysfunction and, throughout the text, advises clinicians to make diagnoses only when symptoms areboth enduring and significant. This mandate seems clinically and ethically satisfying: if no one is suffering or being negatively affected, there is no disorder.A heated debate remains, however, in regard to clusters of behaviors, cognitions, and feelings that are not intrinsically pathological but are problematic because they exist within a certain social structure. Perhaps nowhere is this debate more heated than in the discussion of sexual behavior. Historically, for example, homosexuality was classified as a psychiatric disorder. At least partly in response to political pressure, the diagnosis of homosexuality was changed in DSM-III to a diagnosis of unhappiness over being homosexual (ego-dystonic homosexuality). DSM-IV included persistent and marked distress about sexual orientation as a \"sexual disorder not otherwise specified.\" DSM-5 has moved further away from pathologizing homosexuality by eliminating all specific references to sexual orientation as a cause of psychiatric disturbance. Obviously, people who engage in or fantasize about sex with people of the same gender can have any of the DSM-5 diagnoses-and they can also be unhappy about their sexuality-but their sexual orientation is not viewed as a contributor privileged over any other characteristic.Historically, gender identity referred to an individual's identification as a male or female. Typically, gender identity was viewed as binary and consistent with biological markers such as chromosomes and external genitalia. Some well-known clinics provided evaluations and treatment to assist people with discordant gender identities in their efforts to develop a body that matched their internal identities; however, for most psychiatrists, gender identity was rarely much of an issue.Societal shifts have muddied these waters, and there are increasing numbers of people who do not see themselves as falling into traditional dichotomies (male/female; heterosexual/homosexual) and instead connect best with identities such as transgender, queer, and gender-fluid.DSM-III and DSM-IV entered these complex and largely uncharted waters with diagnoses (transsexualism and gender identity disorder, respectively) that indicated that the clinical problem was the discordant gender identity. DSM-5 moved further in the direction of depathologizing discordant gender identity by introducing a new diagnosis, gender dysphoria, that emphasizes clinically significant distress or dysfunction alongwith the discordance.The diagnosis of gender dysphoria may reflect a compromise between conflicting, pragmatic goals. For example, having a diagnosis that specifically references gender identity issues might be important for people who seek insurance coverage for gender reassignment surgery and hormonal therapy, as well as for transgender people who seek legal protection when they have experienced discrimination based on gender identity.On the other hand, it might be possible for a diagnosis related to gender identity to be used in legal settings as an indicator of some sort of pathology.DSM-5-TR is not, however, most concerned with the financial and legal ramifications of its nomenclature. It also seems unlikely that DSM-5 intends the term gender dysphoria to refer primarily to psychological reactions to societal prejudice; discrimination comes in many forms, and no other triggers for discrimination are privileged with their own diagnosis. DSM-5 also clarifies that the diagnosis does not refer simply to gender nonconformity or transvestism.Instead, the DSM-5-TR diagnosis of gender dysphoria reflects a clinical reality: a subset of patients present with unhappiness that seems bound up with the discordance between their bodies and their sense of self as well as the reality that surgical and hormonal interventions are far from perfected. Although perhaps an imperfect label, gender dysphoria is intended to improve the likelihood that these patients' specific issues will be the subject of effective clinical attention.Suggested ReadingsBr\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnstr\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm R, Pachankis JE: Reduction in mental health treatment utilization among transgender individuals after gender-affirming surgeries: a total population study.

She tried to figure out whether this sense had existed earlier, but all she could recall was occasionally wishing she were a girl to fit in more comfortably with her friends.By age 20, Ms. Rohmer was very unhappy about being seen as a man. She viewed her genitalia as \"repugnant\" and a \"mistake of nature.\" Her family and some of her friends had not supported her developing sense of herself, and she recalled feeling increasingly hopeless, with episodic suicidal ideation and one nonlethal suicide attempt by overdoseat age 21.Beginning at age 22, Ms. Rohmer lived as a female, including changing her name and exclusively wearing women's clothes. She struggled to access appropriate health services and encountered multiple barriers to obtaining appropriate treatments, but, at the age of 24, Ms. Rohmer was evaluated by two psychiatrists skilled in transgender health, who agreed with her perspective, and she started gender-affirming hormone therapy.As her transition progressed, she began to feel more comfortable in the female role and pleased with having secondary sexual characteristics that were more consistent with her experienced gender. She explored her sexuality during this time, dating both gay and straight men. Her anxiety diminished, although, as a member of a disenfranchised subgroup, she felt vulnerable to various types of aggression, including potential partner violence.The following year, at age 25, Ms. Rohmer had the gender on her driver's license and passport changed from male to female (a change of gender markers) and underwent gender-affirming surgeries that included vaginoplasty and breast augmentation. The results of these surgeries were satisfactory, and she was often happy with the transition. She described herself as being \"more comfortable in her skin\" than she had ever been, and she only infrequently felt hopeless and suicidal. Despite not feeling particularly accepted by her family of origin or by some of her old friends, she found warm support from other friends and colleagues at work. Although she has many friends who are gender nonbinary/gender nonconforming, Ms. Rohmer identifies as a heterosexual female.She said she tended to worry that people were judging her negatively, but this worry was less intense now than it had been earlier in her transition. She denied any recent suicide attempts, depression, or self-injurious behavior. She said she had \"almost\" given up on having a successful relationship but was \"somehow\" still optimistic that something would work out.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \n\nGender dysphoria, posttransition\n\nSuggested ReadingsClaahsen-van der Grinten H, Verhaak C, Steensma T, et al: Gender incongruence and gender dysphoria in childhood and adolescence-current insights in diagnostics, management, and follow-up.

Coccaro, M.D.https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9781615375295.jb15IntroductionJohn W. Barnhill, M.D.Executive functions help control and regulate attention, memory, and behavior. They are critical to adaptation, to the initiation and completion of tasks, and to the ability to delay gratification. They inhibit inappropriate, dangerous, and hurtful behaviors.Impaired executive functioning is a key feature of all of the disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders. These conditions include oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, pyromania, and kleptomania, as well as categories for people who have clinically relevant symptoms but do not meet criteria for a named disorder.Other DSM-5 disorders are associated with impulsivity, poor planning, and interpersonal conflicts, and these other disorders-ranging from attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder to substance use disorders to some of the personality disorders- are frequently comorbid with the disorders described in this chapter. Furthermore,disruptive impulsivity is associated with substance use, HIV and hepatitis C infections, traumatic brain injury, and all manner of dangerous behavioral patterns that reflect impaired executive functioning and can lead to intensifying cycles of dysfunctional behavior.All of the disorders in this chapter tend to start early in life, which is unsurprising given the relative immaturity of executive functioning during childhood and adolescence. If the clinical interview indicates that one of the disruptive, impulse-control, or conduct disorders has suddenly sprouted during the adult years, the individual most likely either has developed a serious neuropsychiatric disorder or has not provided an accurate history. On the other hand, children who present with one of these disorders do not inevitably go on to develop pervasively damaging diagnoses such as antisocial personality disorder or lifelong intermittent explosive disorder. However, they are at risk for ongoing problems, including depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders.These children are also at risk for encountering a disproportionate amount of societal trouble, and DSM-5 provides a structure for investigating severity. In individuals with oppositional defiant disorder, for example, pervasiveness of symptoms across settings is a useful marker for severity, whereas \"limited prosocial emotions\" is a specifier for conduct disorder that identifies greater severity and a different treatment response.Poorly controlled behaviors and emotions lie on a continuum, and most sporadically impulsive behavior and dysregulated emotions do not indicate a DSM-5 disorder but rather immaturity intensified by situational issues such as family and interpersonal strife, substance intoxication, and peer pressure. As is the case throughout DSM-5, the onus is on the clinician to carefully consider the point at which thoughts, feelings, and behaviors cross the line into a level of distress and dysfunction that warrants a diagnosis.Particularly relevant variables include frequency, setting, and duration of the troublesome episodes. An accurate history is necessary to gather this information. Such an investigation can be stymied by the fact that, as is the case with the personality disorders, people other than the identified patient may be more distressed than the patient. Furthermore, psychiatric history tends to depend on patient honesty, and many of these patients are not spontaneously and transparently forthcoming. For thesereasons, evaluations are often initiated by family and institutions (school, work, the legal system) and are unlikely to be complete without collateral information.Suggested ReadingsBuitelaar JK, Smeets KC, Herpers P: Conduct disorders.

When confronted by his mother, stepfather, or a teacher, he had long tended to curse, punch, and show no concern for possible punishment. Disruptive, impulsive, and \"fidgety,\" Kyle was diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and placed in a special education program by second grade. He began to see a psychiatrist in fourth grade for weekly psychotherapy and medications (quetiapine and dexmethylphenidate). He was adherent only sporadically with both the medication and the therapy. When asked why this was, he replied that his psychiatrist was \"stupid.\"During the year prior to the admission, he had been caught stealing from school lockers(a cell phone, a jacket, a laptop computer), disciplined after \"mugging\" a classmate for his wallet, and suspended after multiple physical fights with classmates. He had been arrested twice for these behaviors. His mother and teachers agreed that although he could be charming to strangers, people quickly caught on to the fact that he was a \"con artist.\" Kyle was consistently unremorseful, externalizing of blame, and uninterested in the feelings of others. He was disorganized, was inattentive and uninterested in following instructions, and constantly lost his possessions. He generally did not do his homework, and when he did, his performance was erratic. When confronted about his poor performance, he tended to say, \"And what are you going to do, shoot me?\" Kyle, his mother, and his teachers agreed that he was a loner and not well liked by his peers.Kyle lived with his mother, stepfather, and two younger half-siblings. His stepfather was unemployed, and his mother worked part-time as a cashier in a grocery store. His biological father was in prison for drug possession. Both biological grandfathers had a history of alcohol use disorder.Kyle's early history was normal. The pregnancy was uneventful, and he reached all of his milestones on time. There was no history of sexual or physical abuse. Kyle had no known medical problems, alcohol or substance abuse, or participation in gang activities. He had not been caught with weapons, had not set fires, and had not been seen as particularly cruel to other children or animals. He had been regularly truant from school but had neither run away nor stayed away from home until late at night.When interviewed on the psychiatric unit, Kyle was casually groomed and appeared his stated age of 12. He was fidgety and made sporadic eye contact with the interviewer. He said he was \"mad\" and insisted he would rather be in jail than on a psychiatric unit. His speech was loud but coherent, goal directed, and of normal rate. His affect was irritable and angry. He denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. He denied psychotic symptoms. He denied feeling depressed. He had no obvious cognitive deficits but declined more formal testing.

He came to the office with his wife, the mother of their two young children. The couple agreed that Mr. Sandahl had become \"almost impossible to live with.\" Mrs. Sandahl reported that although she had always considered her husband \"high-strung,\" his outbursts were increasing in both frequency and intensity, and she worried that he would become violent with her.Their most recent argument began when Mr. Sandahl came home after a \"hard day at work\" to find that dinner was not ready. When he entered the kitchen and saw his wife sitting at the table reading the newspaper, he \"exploded\" and launched into a tirade about how \"bad\" a wife she was. When Mrs. Sandahl tried to explain her own long day, Mr. Sandahl cursed at her and broke glassware and a kitchen chair. Terrified, she ran out of the kitchen, gathered up the toddlers, and left for her mother's house a few miles away. The next day, she told her husband that he would need to get help immediately or prepare for a divorce.Mr. Sandahl said his \"blowups\" began in childhood but did not become \"problematic\" for him until age 13. At about that time, he started having frequent fights with classmates that would occasionally result in trips to the principal's office. In between the altercations, he was active socially and a solid student.Mr. Sandahl estimated that he had had approximately four verbal outbursts a week in recent years, generally in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults. In addition to these heated verbal tussles, Mr. Sandahl described acts of violence about every 2 months; for example, he threw a computer monitor across the room when it started \"acting up,\" he kicked a hole in a wall when one of his children would not quit crying, and he destroyed his mobile phone during an argument with his mother. He denied physical fights since his adolescence, although he had nearly come to blows with a neighbor as well as an assortment of strangers and employees. The idea that he might physically hurt someone scared Mr. Sandahl \"to the core.\"These outbursts blighted his relationships with colleagues and romantic partners and led to his decision to start his own landscaping company at age 25. The business had done well, despite his demanding style and \"hair-trigger\" temper that led to high employee turnover.Mr. Sandahl described the episodes as short-lived, reaching a peak within seconds and rarely lasting more than a few minutes. Between episodes, he described himself as feeling \"fine.\" He had experienced brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but these had not impaired him significantly and tended to resolve on their own within a week. Mr. Sandahl drank socially, but neither he nor his wife linked the outbursts to the alcohol. He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.Mr. Sandahl reported at least two other immediate family members with significant \"anger issues.\" His father was emotionally abusive and perfectionistic, expecting \"great things\" from his only son. Mr. Sandahl's older sister also had problems with her temper; he attributed her three divorces to her emotionally abusive behavior.On examination, Mr. Sandahl was casually dressed, cooperative, and coherent. He was worried about his behavior and contrite toward his wife. He denied depression, psychosis, and confusion. He denied any thoughts of hurting himself or others. He was cognitively intact.

DSM-5 includes several specifiers to further characterize the substance use disorders; these specifiers relate to course (e.g., early remission, sustained remission) and severity (based on the number of criteria endorsed). Notably, the diagnosis of substance use disorder has replaced the prior categories of substance abuse and dependence.DSM-5 also provides diagnostic criteria for clinical presentations that are directly related to substance use, such as intoxication and withdrawal, along with descriptive specifiers.For example, if an individual presents with alcohol intoxication, the clinician can add a code indicating the presence or absence of a comorbid alcohol use disorder. For patients who maintain a clear sensorium during alcohol withdrawal but also develop perceptual disturbances, the DSM-5 diagnosis would likely be alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances. In the much more likely event that the perceptual disturbances are accompanied by confusion, the diagnosis would shift to an alcohol withdrawal delirium (a disorder listed in the chapter on neurocognitive disorders rather than the chapter on substance-related disorders).Substance use can also result in symptom clusters that resemble a broad array of psychiatric diagnoses, including depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders. DSM-5 clarifies a diagnostic approach that is based significantly on course and the likely impact of the substance in question. For example, if depressive symptoms occur during acute withdrawal from cocaine, the depressive symptoms would be deemed to be part of the withdrawal. If the clinically significant depressive symptoms begin in the context of cocaine use and then persist after cessation of the cocaine use and beyond the expected duration of withdrawal, the individual would likely qualify for a cocaine-induced depressive disorder. If the significant depressive symptoms persist an appreciable amount of time (e.g., 1 month) following the cessation of cocaine use, then the patient would likely be evaluated as having an independent major depressive disorder. In that event, the cocaine use might be seen as a trigger but would no longer be part of the DSM-5 diagnosis.Gambling disorder is the only behavioral addiction in the chapter. Evidence indicates that behavioral addictions such as gambling have much in common with substance use disorders, including pattern of use and activation of the same reward system in the brain. Other behavioral addictions are being considered for future editions of DSM.Suggested ReadingsAvery JD, Barnhill JW (eds): Co-Occurring Mental Illness and Substance Use Disorders: A Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment.

Mr. Tucker denied having had a drink since making the appointment 3 days earlier.For 20 years after high school, Mr. Tucker typically drank 3-5 beers per evening, five times per week. Over the last 7 years, he had consumed alcohol almost daily, with an average of 6 beers on weeknights and 12 beers on weekends and holidays. His wife repeatedly voiced her concern that he was \"drinking too much,\" but despite his efforts to limit his alcohol intake, Mr. Tucker continued to spend much of the weekend drinking, sometimes missing family get-togethers, and often passed out while watching TV in the evening. He remained productive at work, however, and never called in sick. In many ways, his history represented what is typically seen in alcohol use disorder. Mr. Tucker had achieved two 30-day periods of abstinence in the previous 4 years. Both times, he said he had quit drinking \"cold turkey\" in response to his wife's concerns. He denied having had symptoms of alcohol withdrawal either time.In the 6 months prior to the evaluation, Mr. Tucker had become uncharacteristically irritable, fatigued, dysphoric, and worried. He was unable to enjoy his usual activities, including food and sex, and had difficulty concentrating. He also reacted more emotionally to stresses and expressed unsubstantiated concern about the future of his business. The patient often awoke at 2:00 a.m. and had trouble getting back to sleep.Mr. Tucker and his wife indicated that although this period of sadness had lasted 6months, he had experienced several similar episodes in the prior 5 years, lasting 4-6 weeks each. They denied any such episodes earlier in his life.Mr. Tucker had been married for 18 years, and he and his wife had one 17-year-old daughter. The patient was a high school graduate with 2 years of community college who currently owned a successful plumbing company. He denied any other history of psychiatric or medical problems, as well as any history of mania or suicide attempts.

For many years, Mr. Underwood had drunk alcohol only after work, but about a year prior to the evaluation he had begun to routinely drink in the morning whenever he had the day off. More recently, he had begun to feel \"shaky\" every morning and would sometimes treat that sensation with a drink, followed by more alcohol during the day.Mr. Underwood experienced a number of problems related to drinking. His wife was \"at the end of her rope\" and considering divorce. His diminished ability to concentrate at work was \"sinking\" his once-promising career. He was spending more time trying to recover from the effects of drinking and found himself planning strategies both for abstinence and for surreptitiously taking his next drink.Mr. Underwood first tried alcohol in high school and said that he had always been able to hold his liquor more than his friends could. In college, he was one of the heaviest drinkers in a fraternity known as \"Animal House\" around campus. Through his 30s, he gradually increased the frequency of his drinking from primarily on weekends to daily.Over the prior year, he had switched from being exclusively a beer drinker to drinking vodka. He had gone to many Alcoholics Anonymous meetings over the years but tended to drink as soon as the meeting ended. He had received no formal treatment.The patient denied recent use of other substances; he had smoked marijuana and snorted cocaine several times during college but never since.

Mr. Vincent came out to his Irish Catholic family when he was 19. His parents had already guessed that Mr. Vincent was gay long before he told them, and they took the non-news fairly well. Their main concern had been that their son might be discriminated against because of his sexuality, get hurt, and live a lonely life. Nothing could be farther from the way things turned out: Mr. Vincent was \"out and proud\" and living it up.When Mr. Vincent found himself with a substance use problem, he addressed it the sameway he had dealt with pretty much everything else: head on. For the first time in his life, he decided to see a psychiatrist.Mr. Vincent described a pattern that revolved around weekend \"party and play\" activities. On Friday and Saturday evenings-and occasionally during the week-he would go out to dinner with friends and then to a club or a private party. He tended to drink two or three cocktails and four to five glasses of wine during the evening.

Bath salts is slang for a powder that contains a variety of synthetic stimulants (e.g., cathinone derivatives).Since Mr. Vincent had started using cocaine regularly, he had lost weight and had trouble sleeping. He worried that his effort at the gym was going to waste. His business continued to succeed, but his own effectiveness had decreased. Most importantly, he did not practice safer sex when high on stimulants, and because he did not want to be on a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen, he worried about HIV seroconversion.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \n\nCocaine use disorder, moderate\n\nSuggested ReadingsLevounis P, Ruggiero JS: Outpatient management of crystal methamphetamine dependence among gay and bisexual men: how can it be done?

When he ran out of the pills and his pain persisted, he went to the emergency room. He was told he had a mild sprain. He was given a 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. He took the pills as prescribed for 1 month, and his pain resolved.After stopping the pills, however, Mr. Winters began to experience a recurrence of the pain in his knee. He saw an orthopedist, who ordered imaging studies and determined that there was no structural damage. Mr. Winters was given another 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. This time, however, he needed to take more than prescribed in order to ease the pain. He also felt dysphoric and \"achy\" when he abstained from taking the medication, and described a \"craving\" for more opioids. He returned to the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.Mr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he stopped the medication. He also began to \"enjoy the high\" and experienced intense craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating theimpact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.Mr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. His father suffered from depression, and \"almost everyone\" on his mother's side of the family had \"issues with addiction.\" He had been married to his wife for 20 years, and they had two school-age children. He had been a minister in his church for 15 years. Results of a recent physical examination and laboratory testing performed by his primary care physician had been within normal limits.On mental status examination, Mr. Winters was cooperative and did not exhibit any psychomotor abnormalities. He answered most questions briefly, often simply saying \"yes\" or \"no.\" Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality. He reported that his mood was \"lousy,\" and his affect was dysphoric and constricted. He denied symptoms of paranoia or hallucinations. He denied any thoughts of harming himself or others.

At the time of the appointment, he had been without a permanent home for over 6 months. He had lived in various places, including his car and friends' homes. For over 1 month prior to presentation, he had been living in a tent in the woods. He had called his parents on his recent birthday, and they had offered to pay for substance use disorder treatment as longas they could pay directly.Mr. Xavier reported that his problem started at age 24, when he had a new wife and young child and had taken on two jobs to make ends meet (working in a factory and as a local delivery driver). When he injured his back and could not get to work because of the pain, a friend offered him a few tablets of acetaminophen-oxycodone (Percocet). Not only did his pain disappear, but his energy and mood improved. For the first time in his life, he felt \"normal and happy.\"Mr. Xavier continued to use one to four Percocet tablets per day for 11/2 years. He never took more than one pill at a time. Then, at age 26, he snorted half a bag of heroin (about$5 on the street). \"It took about 10 minutes, but I was transported into an indescribable euphoria. Like taking that first Percocet times 10.        You chase that first feeling for therest of your life. It never repeats.\" Within months of starting heroin, he began using it intravenously in an effort to glimpse the euphoria again.After that first experience with heroin, the progression of use was rapid. Within6 months, Mr. Xavier was unemployed, separated from his family, and homeless. \"I was sleeping in my car or on the streets        using up to 30 bags [$300] daily.\"Mr. Xavier began to reach out for help. He enrolled in outpatient rehabilitation for opioid users. The cravings to use, even while in treatment, were intense. Mr. Xavier reported multiple relapses. He added cocaine to the heroin injections, and \"speedballs\" became Mr. Xavier's drug of choice for a while, but he then returned to using only heroin. The first of multiple accidental overdoses occurred in a vacant house when he was 27. He had been admitted to \"about 10 detoxes and rehabs\" but would typically relapse within hours or weeks of discharge. He had also gone sporadically to Narcotics Anonymous meetings for years.To acquire money for his habit, he broke into homes, stole from relatives, and wrote bad checks. \"Every penny went to drugs. I'm lucky not to be in prison, but not so lucky in that everybody hates me.\"He decided to move to Martha's Vineyard a year prior to the consultation because it \"sounded like a quiet place.\" He brought some methadone with him, but the eventualwithdrawal was \"fierce.\"He continued to use heroin and oxycodone when he could easily get them. Otherwise, he drank alcohol heavily, although he said, \"I need to stop drinking-that's what really gets me in trouble.\" He also took diazepam (Valium) sporadically; however, he did not consider that to be a problem but more of a way to get through the day.He worked occasionally as a landscaper. His boss-someone he had met at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting-had made it clear that he would call when there was extra work to be done, but that until Mr. Xavier got clean, the boss would not actually expect him to show up. He had held a variety of other odd jobs, including office supplies salesman, veterinary assistant, and gas station attendant. He had not seen his daughter in over 2 years.On examination, Mr. Xavier appeared somewhat unkempt. He was generally cooperative but appeared restless, and at one point he urgently left the room; when he returned, he reported that he was experiencing bouts of diarrhea. His pupils were enlarged and his skin was remarkable for sweating and piloerection. He yawned several times and appeared irritable and unhappy. His arms and legs frequently twitched. He repeatedly blew his nose and appeared tearful. His speech was rapid, and he appeared impatient.He denied psychotic symptoms, suicidality, and homicidality. He said he was hopeful that if he could get some Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone), he might be able to keep a job and maybe get to be a real father.Laboratory studies were negative for HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \n\nOpioid withdrawal\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nOpioid use disorder\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nAlcohol use disorder\n\nSuggested ReadingShorter D, Kosten T: The pharmacology of opioids, in The ASAM Principles of Addiction Medicine, 6th Edition.

This was his first psychiatric evaluation. He reported no past psychiatric history.Mr. Yates traced his increased stress to a death in his city 4 months earlier. The death was recorded on video and featured an unarmed Black man being murdered by two white off-duty policemen who had accused him of theft. Like many people, Mr. Yates first saw the video via his social media \"timeline,\" where it was routinely reposted by his friends. Because the murder had occurred in his hometown, it received much local attention.Mr. Yates's social media timeline began to fill up with other examples of police brutality toward Black men. He said he watched the videos because they were \"trending\" and appeared on his social media timeline abruptly, unfiltered, and without warning. In addition, he became increasingly aware of news programming, social media posts, and community memorials relating to the deaths and abuse of other Black men. Although he described trying to avoid details about these tragedies, he said that news, images, and videos were unavoidable, and he had become increasingly preoccupied with fears for the safety of his wife, his young sons, his extended family, and himself.Mr. Yates reported that under normal circumstances, he \"didn't like to talk about this stuff,\" but his wife had insisted that he get treatment because she was concerned that he \"didn't seem himself.\" Mr. Yates wanted the evaluating psychiatrist to understand that he was not paranoid or overly sensitive about racism, and that up until recently, he'd been good about \"compartmentalizing.\" Nevertheless, he admitted that it had become difficult to stop thinking about violence against unarmed Black men. He had recently disabled his social media accounts in a proactive effort to minimize his exposure to images and commentary regarding the incidents. In addition to stopping use of social media, he reported avoidance of newspapers, the internet, and television.Mr. Yates noted that he had also become edgy, nervous, and always on guard against attack. He had gradually reduced his explorations around the city, preferring to stay close to home. Although he had previously jogged every morning before work, he quit jogging in the local community park because he \"didn't want any trouble.\" Mr. Yatesreported his sleep over the past 3 months as being interrupted by vivid, disturbing dreams of being chased by police officers.For Mr. Yates, evenings were particularly stressful, and he had recently increased his use of alcohol and cannabis to \"unwind\" at the end of the day. He also had begun to drink a six-pack, or more, of beer after dinner, often \"passing out\" in the family den. The alcohol helped him to relax, and smoking \"a blunt\" of marijuana before bedtime improved his sleep and reduced nightmares. He stated that the biggest problem with the cannabis was his wife's complaining that their young children might see him using it or that his use might be detected in a random urine toxicology screen at work. Mr. Yates had been increasingly late to work but had not mentioned to his wife that he had twice been reprimanded by his supervisor for the lateness.Mr. Yates reported first using both cannabis and alcohol at fraternity parties when he was about 19 years old. Throughout college, he smoked small amounts of marijuana once or twice weekly and rarely drank more than two beers at a time. In the decade since his college graduation, he had smoked marijuana only occasionally and tended to have no more than 1 or 2 beers on the weekend. He had never smoked tobacco or used other substances. His use of alcohol and cannabis had not increased until 3 months prior to the evaluation, after he started seeing the videos.Mr. Yates denied experiencing feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or hopelessness. He reported no prior history of panic attacks, mania, psychosis, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and he had never received psychiatric hospitalization or outpatient treatment. He denied suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or previous history of suicidality.

He denied having any prior history of a psychiatric or substance use disorder. He was appropriately dressed and groomed, expressed himself fluently in both English and Spanish, spoke in normal tone and volume, and on examination presented with intact cognitive function and average intelligence.Mr. Zambrano had been betting on sports and playing cards since childhood, noting in the evaluation that gambling \"is part of our culture.\" His own father's favorite hobby and stress reliever had been to play poker with friends at night, and Mr. Zambrano remembered with affection the father-son camaraderie they shared on these occasions.Poker became for him a familial activity that he increasingly used to relieve work-related stress.

Neurocognitive Disorders? Full AccessEdited by:John W. Barnhill, M.D., John W. Barnhill, M.D., Jos\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd R. Maldonado, M.D., Peter V. Rabins, M.D., M.P.H., George S.

Hales, M.D., M.B.A.https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9781615375295.jb17IntroductionJohn W. Barnhill, M.D.Neurocognitive disorders feature prominent, acquired cognitive deficits. These cognitive disorders can be divided into two broad groups-acute delirium and the more chronic neurocognitive disorders (NCDs)-each of which can be further characterized.Delirium is characterized as a fluctuating disturbance of attention, awareness, and cognition that develops acutely and in the context of one or more identified physiological precipitants. Delirium can be further characterized in regard to such factors as duration, activity level, and etiology. Most often encountered among medically hospitalized and/or substance-abusing patients, delirium requires a careful search for etiology-which is often multifactorial. If the delirium is caused by substance withdrawal or intoxication, the pertinent diagnosis is delirium, comorbid with possible substance use disorders. For example, a patient might be coded as having alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute, hyperactive, along with an alcohol use disorder.In addition to describing acute delirium, this chapter of DSM-5-TR also describes chronic neurocognitive disorders. Although acute delirium and the chronic neurocognitive disorders are separated in regard to their diagnostic criteria, DSM-5-TR recognizes that mounting evidence indicates that delirium is significantly associated with long-term cognitive decline.Two other aspects of the nomenclature may also be confusing. First, most of the chronic neurocognitive disorders have been generally described as dementias. Although still in use, the term dementia is sometimes seen as having a pejorative connotation. In addition, this term may better fit the disorders that are progressive and most commonly affect older adults (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) rather than the abrupt and static cognitive decline typically seen in a disorder such as traumatic brain injury (TBI).A second issue is that the term neurocognitive implies an emphasis on cognitive deficits. All of the NCDs involve multiple deficits, however, and DSM-5 suggests that the workup for an NCD include an assessment of executive functions such as complex attention, learning and memory, language, visuoconstructional perceptual ability, and social cognition. Furthermore, all of the NCDs can have prominent personality and behavioral components that may be the most visible and dysfunctional aspect of the clinical presentation.The neurocognitive disorders are divided into major and mild categories based on the person's cognitive functioning and level of practical independence.Major neurocognitive disorder conforms to criteria for dementia that have long been used within psychiatry, medicine, and neurology; these criteria identify clusters of people with similar deficits and care needs.Mild neurocognitive disorder was a new category in DSM-5 and represents an attempt to identify clusters of patients whose impairment may be relatively subtle but still significant. As is true throughout psychiatry, clinical judgment is required to avoid excessive pathologizing. For example, occasional \"senior moments\" are not mild NCD. Instead, mild NCD is intended to identify people whose deficits are impairing their quality of life to the extent that they warrant clinical attention. A second reason for creating a mild NCD diagnosis is the reality that most of the major neurocognitivedisorders are inexorably progressive, and the effort to reduce their catastrophic impact will likely include recognition and treatment at an early stage of disease progression.Suggested ReadingsArciniegas DB, Yudofsky SC, Hales RE (eds): The American Psychiatric Association Publishing Textbook of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 6th Edition.Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association Publishing, 2018Goldberg TE, Chen C, Wang Y, et al: Association of delirium with long-term cognitive decline: a meta-analysis.

It was late in the evening, and no one from the admitting team was available, but a social work note in the chart indicated that the patient's fracture appeared to have been the result of his tripping in his messy apartment. The note also stated that the patient had no children or known living family.The neighbor who had brought Mr. Alvarez to the hospital had stated that the patient had been more reclusive in recent years and that his self-care had worsened after his wife's death 6 months earlier. Up until the day of the surgery, however, he had been able to function independently in his apartment. The neighbor, a nurse, also mentioned thatwhile they were waiting for the ambulance, her husband had sat with Mr. Alvarez while she searched the apartment for pill bottles. She said she had found only an unopened bottle of acetaminophen and a dusty bottle of a medication used for hypertension.Routine admission laboratory results indicated that Mr. Alvarez had an elevated blood urea nitrogen level, a low albumin level, and a high normal mean corpuscular volume. His blood pressure was 160/110. In addition to medications related to the surgery, the chart indicated that he had received haloperidol 2 mg after a bout of agitation.

He had gradually stopped playing golf and cards, activities he had enjoyed \"for decades.\" He had explained that seeing his friends was no longer \"fun,\" and he generally refused to socialize. Instead, he sat on the couch all day, worrying about finances and the future. He denied sadness, however, and any suicidal or homicidal ideation.

He and his wife had been married for 45 years, denied significant discord, and had three children and four grandchildren who were in good health. Premorbidly, he had been outgoing, energetic, and well organized.Mr. Cullman's medical history was notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was taking lisinopril, metformin, simvastatin, and venlafaxine.Mental status examination revealed an alert, cooperative man who was neatly dressed and who had a steady but slow gait and no abnormal movements other than psychomotor slowing. Mr. Cullman's speech was soft in volume but normal in rate and rhythm, without paraphasic errors. He had a limited range of emotional expression, denied feeling sad or guilty, but felt he had retired too early. He denied self-blame, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts or plans. He was aware that his wife was concerned and acknowledged that he was less energetic and active than in the past. He ascribed these changes to his retirement. He said he was generally satisfied with his life.On cognitive examination, Mr. Cullman was oriented except for the date. He remembered one of three objects in 2 minutes, performed three of five serial 7 subtractions correctly, named four common objects correctly, and repeated a complex sentence accurately. He was able to draw the face of a clock and place the numbers correctly but was not able to correctly place the hands at 10 minutes after 2.

His wife had been trying to get him in for an evaluation for years and had finally become desperate enough to enlist his brothers to bring him for the evaluation.Mrs. Estel described her husband's problems as starting when he retired from his job as a plumbing contractor at age 65. He had seemed \"out of sorts\" almost immediately, and she had wondered at the time whether he was getting depressed. He became uncharacteristically forgetful, misplacing items and neglecting to pay bills. He had trouble with appointments, medications, and calculations. He had refused to see a physician until he was involved in a traffic accident a few years prior to this evaluation. At that time, a physician had found no significant physical injuries but had said that the accident was caused by inattention and diminished depth perception; she had recommended that Mr. Estel stop driving, and suggested that he get a more thorough evaluation for early dementia.Over the past year, things had gotten worse. Mr. Estel often could not recall the outcome of sporting events that he had just watched on television, although his memory improved with cues. He resisted activities such as travel and socializing that he had previously enjoyed. A former athlete, he stopped taking walks around the neighborhood after several falls. He quit playing cards with neighbors because the rules had become confusing. He looked depressed and acted apathetic but generally said he was fine. His judgment and problem-solving skills appeared to have significantly declined. Despite having completed 4 years of college and worked for many years as a successful professional plumber, Mr. Estel was now periodically unable to operate household appliances.All of these cognitive problems seemed to fluctuate, so that his wife reported that sometimes he was \"almost like his old self,\" whereas at other times it was \"like living with a zombie, a depressed zombie.\" She also described his frequent exhaustion, daytime drowsiness, and staring spells.When asked specifically about her husband's sleep, Mrs. Estel reported that in fact neither of them slept well. Mainly, she said, it was because of her husband \"acting out his dreams.\" During these episodes, which occurred several times a month, he would punch and scream, and would occasionally fall out of bed. After sustaining bruises as a result of several of the episodes, Mrs. Estel decided it would be safer to sleep on the couch. She recalled that these sleep episodes began just before her husband retired; she had wondered at the time whether he had posttraumatic stress disorder, but she did not think he had suffered any particular trauma. A few years earlier, a friend had offered her a \"sleeping pill\" that had helped her own husband with dementia. Mr. Estel had responded to the unknown medication with extreme rigidity and confusion, and his wife had nearly taken him to the emergency room in the middle of the night.Mrs. Estel denied that her husband had ever had any psychiatric illness. When asked about psychotic symptoms, she said that perhaps every week or so, he swatted at invisible things in the air. She did not think he heard voices or felt suspicious.Mr. Estel's medical history was notable for hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease with a history of stent placement, and possible transient ischemic attacks. His family history was positive for his mother having developed dementia in her mid-70s.On examination, Mr. Estel was a stooped, stiff man who shuffled into the office. While listening to his wife present the history, he stared into space, seeming to pay no attention to the content of the conversation. His right hand was tremulous. He appeared depressed, but when asked, he said he felt fine. His voice was so quiet that words were often unintelligible even when the interviewer leaned close. He drooled at times and did not notice until his wife wiped his chin.When asked to participate in cognitive testing, he shrugged his shoulders and said, \"I don't know.\"", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\n\nMajor neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \n\nRapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder\n\nSuggested ReadingsKarantzoulis S, Galvin JE: Distinguishing Alzheimer's disease from other major forms of dementia.

He is a good judge, but he threatens to kill me, and I can't stop him. I can'tbelieve no one else can see him. Can you help?\"Mr. Franklin reports that his wife had been \"completely fine\" until about a decade earlier, when she was in her early 40s. At that point, he reports that she had become frequently agitated, paranoid, worried, and occasionally aggressive. He had brought her to psychiatrists and internists, and she had received several diagnoses, including late- onset schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, paranoid personality, and anxiety.She and her husband could not recall the names of all of the many psychiatric medications that she had been prescribed over the years, but they included antidepressant, antipsychotic, antianxiety, and mood-stabilizing medications.Ms. Franklin had smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day for many years but only rarely drank alcohol and never used recreational drugs. She had worked as a waitress for 20 years but quit 10 years prior to the evaluation because of too many \"dropped trays,\" misremembered customer orders, and uncharacteristic irritability. Around that time, she was arrested for \"hitting someone\" in a shopping mall, and she and her husband decided she needed to reduce her stress level.The patient had two healthy adult children in their late 20s.

She denied suicidal and homicidal thoughts or plans. On cognitiveexamination, she was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. She had good attention and concentration, although she had significant impairments in both short- and long-term memory. Her performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination and clock drawing test revealed moderate impairment in planning and visuospatial tasks.In the ER, results from extensive laboratory testing were normal.

I have plenty of friends, go out almost every night, and always have lots of fun.\"While Emily was taking some time away from \"the so-called real world,\" her sister was attending Duke University, her younger brother was excelling at a competitive private high school, and both her parents seemed to enjoy their careers as radiologists. She asked, \"Don't you think that's enough strivers for one family?\"Emily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana, alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the changes in Emily's personality as \"an adolescent nightmare\" and described her friends as \"losers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.\" Emily's attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. \"We don't mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn't conservative like the rest of us,\" her father said, \"but it's like we don't even recognize who she's become.\"According to her parents, Emily's \"adolescent nightmare\" began 4 years earlier. She had apparently been a studious 15-year-old girl with a lively sense of humor and a wide circle of \"terrific friends.\" \"Almost overnight,\" she began to shun her longtime friends in favor of \"dropouts and malcontents\" and began to accumulate traffic tickets and school detentions. Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.The abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that shehad taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.On the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year- old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second- highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average in all measures.EEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to that region.Upon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed, Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to anyone. With Emily's permission, the psychiatrist contacted Mark, who was away at college but a willing and excellent historian. He remembered the incident well. \"Emily hit her head very, very hard on the dashboard of my car. She was not totally unconscious but very dazed. For about 3 hours, she spoke very slowly, complained that her head hurt badly, and was confused. For about 2 hours she didn't know where she was or what day it was. She also threw up twice. I was really scared, but Emily didn't want me to worry her parents since they're so overprotective.

It underlies how we think, feel, and act. It frames how we view ourselves and the people around us. When we think of who we are, we often think of personality as the central defining characteristic.Psychiatrists and other mental health care practitioners spend considerable time thinking about personality and the ways in which dysfunctional personalities cause distress and dysfunction in individuals and in the people around them. Disorders of personality are, in some ways, as complex as humanity, itself full of idiosyncrasies, half- articulated conflicts, and unknowable complexities.Like many other complex systems, however, personalities and personality disorders tend to fall into patterns, and, for generations, clinicians and personality researchers from a variety of fields have searched for a holy grail: a nosological system that is both simple touse and sophisticated enough to capture the nuances and paradoxes of human personality.Traditionally, the field of psychiatry has conceptualized personality disorders categorically, as reflecting distinct clinical syndromes. In another paradigm, personality traits are conceptualized dimensionally, as variants that exist on a gradient from maladaptive to normal. A third model incorporates both paradigms, a hybrid categorical-dimensional model.Sociocultural contexts add an additional layer of complexity to the identification of personality disorders. DSM-5 takes advantage of continuing research into the ways in which models of mind vary across cultures, as do cognitive and behavioral norms. For example, sociocultural contexts that emphasize individualism and personal autonomy might be more likely to normalize narcissistic traits.DSM-5 continues to feature the traditional categorical model of personality disorders in the main body of the text. This would generally be seen as the \"official\" model for personality disorders. In addition, DSM-5 includes an alternative hybrid categorical- dimensional model in Section III (Emerging Measures and Models).To better understand the similarities and differences of the two models, it may be useful to explore how the two DSM-5 diagnostic systems recommend that a clinician assess a patient with, for example, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). From a categorical perspective, the individual would receive a diagnosis of OCPD when certain criteria were met. First, the clinician should identify a persistent, dysfunctional pattern of, for instance, perfectionism at the expense of flexibility. The clinician would then identify at least four of seven specific symptomatic criteria (e.g., preoccupation with lists, inability to delegate tasks, stubbornness) and search for disorders that might be responsible for the same symptoms. This investigation might lead to the coding of the other diagnosis only, such as when schizophrenia causes symptoms akin to those found in OCPD. That investigation might also lead to the coding of two or more diagnoses, such as when the person meets criteria for OCPD and another personality disorder.The Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders reshapes the 10 DSM-IV personality disorder categories into a roster of six redefined categories (antisocial,avoidant, borderline, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal). For each of the six categories, the new model requires two assessments. The first involves a determination that the individual has significant impairment in at least two of four personality functioning areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. For each of the six personality disorders, these personality specifics differ. For example, to qualify for OCPD, an individual must demonstrate multiple specific difficulties in personality functioning (e.g., rigidity and lack of empathy) as well as multiple personality traits (e.g., perfectionism, perseveration, and an avoidance of intimacy).The alternative hybrid model then requires an assessment of personality traits that are organized under five broad trait domains. As shown in Table 18-1, these traits and trait domains exist on a spectrum; for example, for one of the five trait domains, antagonism lies on one end of the spectrum and agreeableness on the other. These five broad trait domains are new to many psychiatrists, but they have been rigorously studied for several decades within academic psychology under the rubric of the Five Factor Model, whose personality dimensions include neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness. For each of these personality dimensions, there are clusters of related personality traits. Applied to a particular person, the Five Factor Model can assign a percentile score for each trait. For example, a theoretical person with OCPD might score in the 95th percentile for conscientiousness and in the 5th percentile for openness. DSM-5 adapted these personality dimensions and traits in order to more specifically focus on psychiatric disorders.Alternative DSM-5 model: pathological personality trait domains Enlarge tableTwenty-five specific pathological personality traits are included under the umbrella of these five negative trait domains. For each of the personality disorders, DSM-5 and DSM-5-TR require that the individual demonstrate most of the typical personality traits. For example, the patient with OCPD must demonstrate the trait of rigid perfectionism (an aspect of the trait domain of conscientiousness) as well as at least two of the following three traits: perseveration (an aspect of negative affectivity), intimacy avoidance (an aspect of detachment), and restricted affectivity (also an aspect ofdetachment).The alternative DSM-5 hybrid model also specifies that specific traits can be recorded even if not recognized as part of a diagnosed personality disorder (e.g., hostility, a trait associated with the trait domain of negative affectivity, could be listed alongside any DSM-5 diagnosis and not be considered just a trait associated with, for instance, antisocial personality disorder).Both of the DSM-5 models have advantages and disadvantages. The new DSM-5 hybrid model might contribute to a more nuanced understanding of patients, and its approach takes advantage of decades' worth of personality research. Its complexity is daunting, however, even to seasoned clinicians, and the use of a new system would potentially reduce the usefulness of existing research data within psychiatry.The traditional categorical paradigm has been critiqued for excessive comorbidity and intradisorder heterogeneity, as well as for the fact that one of the most common personality disorder diagnoses in the past has been \"personality disorder not otherwise specified,\" which is clarified only marginally by the DSM-5 options of \"other specified\" and \"unspecified\" personality disorder. On the other hand, the categorical approach is relatively straightforward to use, is familiar to many mental health care practitioners, and follows the categorical structure used throughout the rest of DSM-5. It is also the personality model included in the main body of the DSM-5 text and, as such, remains the American Psychiatric Association's official perspective on personality disorders.Suggested ReadingsGore WL, Widiger TA: The DSM-5 dimensional trait model and five-factor models of general personality.

When asked about his relationships, he described regular, almost daily situations in which he was sure he was being lied to or deceived. He was particularly wary of people in leadership positions and people who had studied psychology and, therefore, had \"training to understand the human mind,\" which they used to manipulate people. Unlike those around him, Mr. Archer believed he did not \"drink the Kool-Aid\" and was able to detect manipulation and deceit.Mr. Archer was employed as an assistant manager for a grocery store chain. He was extremely detail oriented at work, and had trouble delegating and completing tasks. He noted that his coworkers consistently failed to complete tasks the way that he would like. This led him to work routinely long hours \"fixing their mistakes.\" Numerous employers and colleagues had told him that he focused excessively on rules, lists, and small details, and that he needed to be more friendly. He described having held numerous jobs over the years, but he was quick to add, \"I've quit as often as I've been fired.\"During the interview, he emphasized that unlike many people, he understood the value of quality over productivity. He believed that his \"high standards\" had contributed to his \"bad temper\" and emotional \"ups and downs.\" He socialized only \"superficially\" with a handful of acquaintances and could recall the exact moments when previous \"so-called friends and lovers\" had betrayed him. He spent most of his time alone.Mr. Archer denied any significant history of trauma, any current or past problems with substance use, and any history of head trauma or loss of consciousness. He also denied any history of mental health diagnosis or treatment, but he did feel he might have a mental health condition that had not yet been diagnosed. He described some social anxiety and difficulties with academic achievement in childhood, which he attributed to his own high standards and \"unreliable\" childhood friends.On mental status examination, Mr. Archer appeared well groomed, cooperative, and oriented. His speech varied; at times he would pause thoughtfully prior to answering questions and provide very slow, deliberate responses. At other points in the interview he became angry and offered lengthy and digressive responses. However, he seemed generally coherent and did not evidence any perceptual disturbances.

Apparently, his 90-year-old sister had diedsome days earlier after a lengthy illness. Mr. Buchalski had delayed reporting her death for several reasons. He had become increasingly disorganized as his sister's health had worsened, and he was worried that his landlord would use the apartment's condition as a pretext for eviction. He had tried to clean up, but his attempts consisted mainly of moving items from one place to another. He said he was about to call for help when the police and paramedics showed up.In the ER, Mr. Buchalski recognized that his actions were odd and that he should have called for help sooner. At times, he became tearful when discussing the situation and his sister's death; at other times, he seemed aloof, speaking about these in a calm, factual way. He also wanted to clarify that his apartment had indeed been a mess but that much of the apparent mess was actually his large collection of articles on bioluminescence, a topic he had been researching for decades.A licensed plumber, electrician, and locksmith, Mr. Buchalski had worked until age 65. He described his late sister as having been always \"a little strange.\" She had never worked and had been married once, briefly. Aside from the several-month marriage, she and Mr. Buchalski had lived in the family's two-bedroom Manhattan apartment their entire lives. Neither of them had ever seen a psychiatrist.When questioned, Mr. Buchalski stated that he had never had a romantic or sexual relationship and had never had many friends or social contacts outside his family. He explained that he had been poor and Polish and had had to work all the time. He had taken night classes to better understand \"the strange world we live in,\" and he said his intellectual interests were what he found most gratifying. He said he had been upset as he realized that his sister was dying, but he would call it \"numb\" rather than depressed. He also denied any history of manic or psychotic symptoms. After an hour with the psychiatric trainee, Mr. Buchalski confided that he hoped the medical school might be interested in some of his papers after his death. He said he believed that bioluminescent and genetic technologies were on the verge of a breakthrough that might allow the skin of animals and then humans to glow in subtle colors that would allow people to more directly recognize emotions. He had written the notes for such technology, but they had grown into a \"way-too-long science fiction novel with lots of footnotes.\"On examination, Mr. Buchalski was a thin, elderly man dressed neatly in khakis and button-down shirt. He was meticulous and much preferred to discuss his interests in science than his own story. He made appropriate eye contact and had a polite, pleasant demeanor. His speech was coherent and goal directed. His mood was \"fine,\" and his affect was appropriate though perhaps unusually cheerful under the circumstances. He denied all symptoms of psychosis, depression, and mania. Aside from his comments about bioluminescence, he said nothing that sounded delusional. He was cognitively intact, and his insight and judgment were considered generally good, although historically impaired in regard to his delay in calling the police about his sister.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nSchizoid personality disorder\n\nSuggested ReadingsAkhtar S: Schizoid personality disorder: a synthesis of developmental, dynamic, and descriptive features.

Although suspicious about the reason for the referral, he explained that he generally \"followed orders\" and would do what he was asked. He agreed that he had been suspicious of some of his classmates, believing they were undermining his abilities. He said they were telling his instructors that he was \"a weird guy\" and that they did not want him as a lab partner. The referral to the psychiatrist was, he said, confirmation of his perception.Henry described how he had seen two students \"flip a coin\" over whether he was gay or straight. Coins, he asserted, could often predict the future. He had once flipped a coin and \"heads\" had predicted his mother's illness. He believed his thoughts often came true.Henry had transferred to this out-of-town university after an initial year at his local community college. The transfer was his parents' idea, he said, and was part of their agenda to get him to be like everyone else and go to parties and hang out with girls. He said all such behavior was a waste of time. Although they had tried to push him into moving into the dorms, he had refused, and instead lived by himself in an off-campus apartment.With Henry's permission, his mother was called for collateral information. She said Henry had been quiet, shy, and reserved since childhood. He had never had close friends, had never dated, and had denied wanting to have friends. He acknowledged feeling depressed and anxious at times, but these feelings did not improve when he was around other people. He was teased by other kids and would come home upset. His mother cried while explaining that she always felt bad for him because he never really \"fit in,\" and that she and her husband had tried to coach him for years without success. She wondered how a person could function without any social life.She added that ghosts, telepathy, and witchcraft had fascinated Henry since junior high school.

At his initial job interview, Mr. Crocker presented as very motivated and provided two carpentry school certifications that indicated a high level of skill and training. Since his employment began, his supervisors had noted frequent arguments, absenteeism, poor workmanship, and multiple errors that might have been dangerous. When confronted, he was reportedly dismissive, indicating that the problem was \"cheap wood\" and \"bad management\" and added that if someone got hurt, \"it's because of their own stupidity.\"When the head of human resources met with him to discuss termination, Mr. Crocker quickly pointed out that he had both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder. He said that if not granted an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, he would sue. He demanded a psychiatric evaluation.During the mental health evaluation, Mr. Crocker focused on unfairness at the company and on how he was \"a hell of a better carpenter than anyone there could ever be.\" He claimed that his two marriages had ended because of jealousy. He said that his wives were \"always thinking I was with other women,\" which is why \"they both lied to judgesand got restraining orders saying I'd hit them.\" As \"payback for the jail time,\" he refused to pay child support for his two children. He had no interest in seeing either of his two boys because they were \"little liars\" like their mothers.Mr. Crocker said he \"must have been smart\" because he had been able to make Cs in school despite showing up only half the time. He spent time in juvenile hall at age 14 for stealing \"kid stuff, like tennis shoes and wallets that were practically empty.\" He left school at age 15 after being \"framed for stealing a car\" by his principal. Mr. Crocker pointed out these historical facts as evidence that he was able to overcome injustice and adversity. A review of a juvenile probation officer's report indicated that beginning in the first grade, he often bullied children with disabilities, was noted to smile when his victims would cry, and consistently lacked remorse or guilt for his actions.In regard to substance use, Mr. Crocker said he smoked marijuana as a teenager and started drinking alcohol on a \"regular basis\" after he first got married at age 22. He denied that use of either substance was a problem.Mr. Crocker concluded the interview by demanding a note from the examiner that he had \"bipolar\" and \"ADHD.\" He said that he was \"bipolar\" because he had \"ups and downs\" and got \"mad real fast.\" Mr. Crocker denied other symptoms of mania. He said he got down when disappointed, but he had \"a short memory\" and \"could get out of a funk pretty quick.\" Mr. Crocker reported no difficulties in his sleep, mood, or appetite. He learned about ADHD because \"both of my boys got it.\" He concluded the interview with a request for medications, adding that the only ones that worked were stimulants (\"any of them\") and a specific short-acting benzodiazepine.On mental status examination, Mr. Crocker was a casually dressed man who made reasonable eye contact and was without abnormal movements. His speech was coherent, goal directed, and of normal rate. There was no evidence of any thought disorder or hallucinations. He was preoccupied with blaming others, but these comments appeared to represent overvalued ideas rather than delusions. He was cognitively intact. His insight into his situation was poor.The head of human resources did a background check during the course of the psychiatric evaluation. Phone calls revealed that Mr. Crocker had been expelled from twocarpentry training programs and that both of his graduation certificates had been falsified.

She had spent the prior 6 months isolated in her apartment, lying in bed, eating junk food, watching television, and doing more online shopping than she could afford. Multiple treatments had yielded little effect.Ms. Delgado was the middle of three children in an upper-middle-class immigrant family in which the father reportedly valued professional achievement over all else. She felt isolated throughout her school years and experienced recurrent periods of depressed mood. Within her family, she was known for angry outbursts. She had done well academically in high school but dropped out of college because of frustrations with a roommate and a professor.She had attempted a series of internships and entry-level jobs with the expectation that she would return to college, but she kept quitting because \"bosses are idiots.

The fall had left her downcast and depressed, although she denied other depressive symptoms aside from a poor mood. She spoke at length about the fall and about how it reminded her of a fall that she had sustained a few years earlier. At that time, she had gone to see a neurosurgeon, who told her to rest and take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She described feeling \"abandoned and not cared about\" by him. The pain had diminished her ability to exercise, and she was upset that she had gained weight. While relating the events surrounding the fall, Ms. Fuentes began to cry.When asked about her suicidal comments, she said they were \"no big deal\"-they were \"just a threat\" aimed at her husband to \"teach him a lesson\" because \"he has no compassion for me\" and had not been supportive since the fall. She insisted that her comments about overdosing did not have another meaning. When her ER interviewer expressed concern about the possibility that she would kill herself, she exclaimed with asmile, \"Oh wow, I didn't realize it's so serious. I guess I shouldn't do that again.\" She then shrugged and laughed.

Mr. Goranov indicated to the clinic's psychiatric director that he had been depressed for many years, but weekly psychotherapy and multiple different psychiatric medications had made no difference.Mr. Goranov reported feeling sad, tired, and frustrated \"for decades.\" He rarely looked forward to anything. He had lost his last job 3 years earlier, had broken up with a girlfriend slightly later, and doubted that he would ever work or date again. He was embarrassed that he still lived with his mother, who was in her 80s. He denied any immediate intention or plan to kill himself, but stated that if he did not improve by the time his mother died, he did not see what he would have to live for. He denied disturbances in sleep, appetite, or concentration.Clinic records indicated that Mr. Goranov had been adherent to adequate trials of fluoxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion, as well as augmentation with quetiapine, aripiprazole, lithium, and levothyroxine. He had experienced some improvement in his mood while taking escitalopram but did not have remission of symptoms. He also received a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy early in his treatment, but he had been dismissive of the therapist and treatment, did not do his assigned homework, and appeared to make no effort to use the therapy between sessions.Mr. Goranov expressed frustration at his lack of improvement, the nature of his treatment, and his specific therapy. He found it \"humiliating\" that he was forced to see trainees who rotated off his case every year or two. He frequently found that thepsychiatry residents were not especially educated, cultured, or sophisticated, and thought that they knew less about psychotherapy than he did. He much preferred to work with female therapists \"because at least they're pretty, and men are too competitive and envious.\"Mr. Goranov had worked as an insurance broker from age 25 to 40. He explained, \"It's ridiculous. I was the best broker they had ever seen, but I still can't get a job. I think the problem is that the profession is filled with big egos, and I can't keep my mouth shut about it.\" After being \"blackballed\" by insurance agencies, Mr. Goranov did not work for 5 years, until he was hired by an automobile dealer. He said that although it was beneath him to sell cars, he was successful, and \"in no time, I was running the place.\" He quit within a few months after an argument with the owner.

This tendency held true in regard to both women who had tried to befriend him and therapists who had taken an interest in his care. Mr. Goranov described himself as someone who had a lot of love to give, but added that the world was full of manipulators.

She avoided speaking up or talking on telephones, worried about how she would sound. She dreaded public speaking.She was similarly reticent with friends. She said she had always been a people pleaser who preferred to hide her feelings with a cheerful, compliant, attentive demeanor. She had a few friends, whom she described as \"warm and lifelong.\" She felt lonely after her recent move and had not yet met anyone from school or the local community.She said she had broken up with her first serious boyfriend 2 years earlier.

Soon after she moved in with him, however, he turned out to be an \"angry alcoholic.\" She had not dated since that experience.Ms. Herbert grew up in a metropolitan area with her parents and three older siblings. Her brother was \"hyperactive and antisocial\" and took up everyone's attention, whereas her sisters were \"hypercompetitive and perfect.\" Her mother was anxiously compliant, \"like me.\" Ms. Herbert's father was a very successful investment manager who often pointed out ways in which his children did not live up to his expectations. He could be supportive but tended to disregard emotional uncertainty in favor of a \"tough optimism.\" Teasing and competition \"saturated\" the household, and \"it didn't help that I was forced to go to the same girls' school where my sisters had been stars and where everyone was rich and catty.\" She developed a keen sensitivity to criticism and failure.Her parents divorced during her senior year of high school.

She smiled a lot, especially when talking about things that would have made most people angry. When the psychiatrist offered a trial comment, linking Ms. Herbert's current anxiety to experiences with her father, the patient said nothing but was visibly upset.

Cutting back led to anxiety and \"the shakes.\"Mr. Irvin denied any prior personal or family psychiatric history, including outpatient psychiatric appointments.After hearing this history, the psychiatrist was concerned about Mr. Irvin's escalating alprazolam use and his chronic difficulties with independence. She thought the most accurate diagnosis was benzodiazepine use disorder comorbid with a personality disorder. However, she was concerned about the negative unintended effects that these diagnoses might have on the patient, including his employment and insurance coverage, as well as how he would be dealt with by future clinicians.

Paraphilic Disorders? Full AccessEdited by:John W. Barnhill, M.D., J. Paul Fedoroff, M.D., Richard Balon, M.D., Nancy J. Needell, M.D., John W. Barnhill, M.D.https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9781615375295.jb19IntroductionJohn W. Barnhill, M.D.Paraphilias are defined as intense and persistent sexual interests outside of foreplay and genital stimulation with phenotypically normal, consenting adults. A paraphilic disorder requires both the presence of a paraphilia and the existence of distress, dysfunction, and/or acting on the urges (as described in more detail later in this introduction). The definition of paraphilia is broad enough that there are dozens, even hundreds, of identified paraphilias and paraphilic disorders, all of which are replete with ambiguity and controversy, but DSM-5 specifically identifies only eight: voyeuristic, exhibitionistic, frotteuristic, sexual masochism, sexual sadism, pedophilic, fetishistic, and transvestic disorders.Paraphilias can be divided into those that feature anomalous activities (e.g., sexual masochism) and those that feature anomalous targets (e.g., fetishes). Paraphilias can also be divided into those that are victimless (e.g., transvestism) and those that are defined in such a way that, when enacted, they inevitably include victimization (e.g., sexual sadism and pedophilic disorders).For example, an individual might indicate that he experiences recurrent and intense sexual arousal from either the use of nonliving objects (e.g., shoes) or a focus on a nongenital body part (e.g., feet). If the associated fantasies, urges, or behaviors transcend his \"normophilic\" sexual interests and behaviors, then he can be said to have a specific paraphilia-that is, a fetish. If, on the other hand, the fetish is not intense or persistent but is used as an occasional part of a broad sexual repertoire in the pursuit of genital stimulation, then the individual would likely not meet criteria for a paraphilia. If the fetish leads the individual to experience dysfunction (e.g., clinically relevant sexual difficulties with a partner) or distress (e.g., clinically relevant shame), then he-and people with fetishes are almost always men-would warrant a diagnosis of fetishistic disorder.Some of the paraphilias included in DSM-5 were selected because their enactment inevitably leads to victimization. Voyeurism is the most common of these paraphilias. DSM-5 voyeurism does not refer to someone who casually ogles a passerby or who is sexually excited by \"spying\" on people at a clothing-optional beach. DSM-5 voyeuristic disorder involves nonconsenting persons and, as such, is a criminal activity. The disorder is diagnosed when voyeuristic urges are recurrently enacted, leading to distress or significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. As is the case with all the paraphilias associated with criminal activity, a disorder is also diagnosed even if the individual denies distress and dysfunction, as long as there is a pattern of criminally significant paraphilic behavior. Like the other potentially criminal paraphilias, voyeuristic disorder can also be diagnosed in an individual who does not act on his desires but whose urges or fantasies are causing clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.Some of these paraphilias are associated with particularly heinous crimes. From a forensic perspective, pedophilic disorder identifies people-almost always men-who act on their persistent sexual interest in prepubertal children. From a forensic perspective, the diagnosis is not generally aimed at men who, among their various sexual fantasies, consider teenagers attractive, yet do not break laws or encounter interpersonal difficulty and are not bothered by their fantasies. DSM-5 also clarifies that the child should be less than 13 years old and that the perpetrator should be at least 16 years old and 5 yearsolder than the victim. The primary forensic interest is in behaviors that transcend what is typically meant by sexuality and move into predation and sociopathy. DSM-5 does allow for the pedophilic disorder diagnosis to be made, however, in situations in which the sexual interest in prepubertal children is not enacted but the urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.Similarly, the diagnosis of sexual sadism disorder appears to identify two different clinical populations. In both groups, the individual experiences recurrent and intense sexual arousal from another's suffering, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. The primary forensic interest is in people who force unconsenting children and adults to experience physical and psychological suffering as part of the perpetrator's own pursuit of sexual arousal. In such settings, the sexual sadism disorder is most commonly applied to men with comorbid antisocial personality disorder who are awaiting trial. The diagnosis of sexual sadism disorder can also be used to describe people who do not act on their sadistic urges and/or do not involve unconsenting victims in their behaviors but who experience distress or impairment. Sexual sadism disorder does not apply to the vast majority of people whose sexual behavior and fantasies lie under the broad umbrella of BDSM (bondage, domination/discipline, sadism/submission, and masochism). For the majority of people who engage in practices associated with BDSM, mutual agreement and consent are central. Although the fantasy and the specific behavior may include control, pain, and/or humiliation, the people involved are consenting adults, and most do not appear to suffer associated distress or impairment.Criteria for a paraphilic diagnosis are somewhat unusual among diagnoses in DSM-5. For example, voyeurism, pedophilia, and sexual sadism can be diagnosed when the individual denies distress, dysfunction, sexual arousal, or even any involvement in the activity, as long as there is evidence of involvement that indicates a likelihood of persistent sexual arousal related to the paraphilia. This definition is true for all the paraphilias that tend to lead to criminal behavior, including frotteurism (touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual) and exhibitionism (exposing the genitals to an unconsenting person). The idea that conclusions can be made based on external evidence regardless of psychiatric assessment (including some combination of patient history, clinical observation, and mental status examination) is typical in the legal system but is not typical of most psychiatric evaluations. The inclusion of externalevidence is also not part of the definition for the paraphilias that do not typically involve the criminal justice system.The paraphilias prompt interesting questions. The first is whether the psychiatric nomenclature should get involved in sexual behaviors that are heavily influenced by cultural norms and may lead to little or no distress and dysfunction in the individual. For example, a diagnosis that identifies a cluster of people who sexually abuse prepubertal children (pedophilia) may be useful both for the legal system and for clinicians who create treatment programs. If expanded to include a focused sexual interest in adolescents (so-called hebephilia, which was considered for inclusion but ultimately not discussed in DSM-5), the paraphilia runs up against the wide variations that exist in regard to human maturation and to what is legally and culturally acceptable in different states, countries, and eras.Paraphilia nosology prompts the important question of what, exactly, is the key factor that turns a behavior into a disorder. Is it the atypicality? Is it the individual's distress (e.g., guilt if someone has been hurt)? In the case of paraphilias that feature a victim, is it the effect of the actions (e.g., the hurt person), regardless of the perpetrator's reactions or intent? Is it the compulsive, driven nature of the behavior? Historically, the field of psychiatry was fairly confident about the landmarks and behaviors that could be considered part of normal human sexual development. In the twenty-first century, definitions of sexual normalcy are hotly contested. The DSM paraphilias no longer include, for example, homosexuality, but they do include other sexual behaviors that lack both a victim and inevitable dysfunction or distress (e.g., fetishes and transvestism). The boundaries of paraphilic behaviors are shifting, and it remains to be seen how the field will further incorporate the notion that many atypical patterns of sexual development and behavior are being increasingly seen as normal variations both within the profession and throughout the broader culture.The updated DSM-5-TR made no substantive changes in the criteria for any of the paraphilic disorders. The edits to the discussion section largely involve reminders of cultural variability and updates on evidence.In regard to cultural relativism, DSM-5-TR reminds the reader to distinguish self-harming behaviors that occur during collectively accepted spiritual and societal practices from sadomasochistic behavior conducted for sexual arousal. As examples, DSM-5-TR points to rituals that include self-flagellation and suspension from hooks.Research continues to improve our knowledge base. For example, it has long been recognized that of those people incarcerated with a sexual sadism disorder, the large majority are men. More recent population samples appear to indicate, however, that men are only modestly more likely than women to report sexually sadistic behavior (as opposed to a disorder).Other evidence discussed within DSM-5-TR reflects an expansion of understanding. For example, the group of people with pedophilic disorder is heterogeneous and includes a subset of people who feel particular emotional and cognitive affinity with children, also known as emotional congruence with children. They may prefer the company of children, feel they have more in common with children than adults, and choose jobs or volunteer activities that allow them to spend time with children.Despite the ongoing flux and debate, the current diagnostic approach to the paraphilic disorders is fairly clear and can be considered from two angles. One angle is predominantly legal. If a victim is harmed because of another person's pattern of non- normative sexual behavior, there is likely an underlying paraphilic disorder (as well as a likely comorbidity such as antisocial personality disorder). The second angle does not involve the legal system. If an individual indicates a persistent, non-normative pattern of sexual behavior, urges, or fantasies, then a paraphilia can likely be identified. If that paraphilia directly causes distress or dysfunction, then a disorder can be diagnosed. And through this complexity, it remains a matter of clinical judgment whether this diagnosis merits professional attention.Suggested ReadingsBalon R: Controversies in the diagnosis and treatment of paraphilias.

The two siblings lived together, and the brother threatened to withhold her allowance from a small trust if she didn't get \"some help.\"Raven explained that her brother was worried about her being \"sadomasochistic.\" In public, he might just say that he was worried that she was an alcoholic and out of control, but she thought he just didn't like her interest in \"BDSM\" (bondage, domination/discipline, sadism/submission, and masochism).She said that she had been in a relationship with Lilly for about a year. The two of them self-identified as queer, a label they found less stigmatizing than \"lesbian.\" One evening, after an evening of drinking with her brother, Raven told him that she and Lilly enjoyed going to bondage parties, where they would role-play \"mistress-slave scenes\" in which they would wear tight leather clothing and high heels, and Lilly would whip Raven and call her derogatory or humiliating names. Raven was fine with being seen as a masochist in public, but in private, she generally enjoyed being in charge.Raven asked the psychiatrist whether he was \"the kind of shrink who pathologizes everything? Surely, you're not like my brother, who gets squeamish about anything related to kink. But that's his problem, right doctor? Don't you agree that his concerns are just homophobia?\" She asked whether the psychiatrist had read Justine by the Marquis de Sade, \"which isn't as well written as Lolita, but it strikes a chord. By the way, Lilly laughs at my reading choices, calling me an 'old-school perv.' \"On questioning about other BDSM activities, Raven said she sometimes drugged Lilly without Lilly's knowledge. She found the sense of control to be extremely sexually exciting. Raven said she did not think Lilly would mind if she found out, given that Lilly identified as a sadomasochist and would often let Raven tie her up. Raven admitted that she had secretly drugged previous sexual partners, but that only one had complained about it, and \"only when she found photos on my camera.\" That lover had broken off the relationship immediately and claimed that she would have gone to the police if the \"photos weren't so embarrassing.\"When asked about her brother's concern about her alcohol use, Raven immediately said she did \"no illegal drugs, no tobacco, not even weed.\" Upon further questioning, she did say she might have an alcohol problem. She said she often planned to have a single drink but generally ended up getting significantly intoxicated. She generally got along well with Lilly and her brother, but they often got into verbal fights after everyone had \"become really drunk.\" She said she often enjoyed her \"binges,\" with the only problem being that she often missed early morning classes because of hangovers.

She and her brother had lived with relatives and in foster homes before they had been adopted by a woman whom she referred to as our \"intrusive but well-meaning pseudo-mother.\" That woman had died the year before, leaving behind a small trust fund for the two of them. Raven had memory gaps from her childhood and thought she might have been sexually molested. \"The abuse narrative would make sense, wouldn't it? But I really don't remember.\" Raven's medical history was pertinent for having had scoliosis; as a child, she was treated with insertion of a Harrington rod and an extended hospitalization.Raven described sexual attraction to both men and women but preferred women because \"they are typically more submissive.\" When she masturbated, and when she drugged sexual partners, she fantasized about \"power and control,\" particularly about molesting unwilling partners.She said she felt calm when in sexual control, and when intoxicated, but that sheotherwise felt \"pretty anxious.\" Previous psychiatrists had diagnosed her with generalized anxiety disorder, for which she had been prescribed a benzodiazepine; these were also the medications she used to drug sexual partners.Raven said she sometimes felt down and depressed but did not think she had ever had a \"clinical depression.\" While often anxious, she denied ever having phobias or panic. She denied ever feeling suicidal but had sometimes thought about killing the drugged sexual partners, which, \"as you surely know, I would never actually do.\" She denied obsessions, compulsions, delusions, and hallucinations.

He told police that he believed the man was going to \"tell everyone that I was a faggot\" and that he, Mr. Orren, was trying to protect himself from the \"homosexual conspiracy.\"Mr. Orren had a history of a psychotic disorder, a cocaine use disorder, and nonadherence to medication and psychotherapy at the time of the incident. He was unemployed. In court, Mr. Orren entered a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease (the \"insanity defense\") and underwent a full psychiatric evaluation, including assessment of his sexual history and desires.As part of his legal case, Mr. Orren underwent a structured sex offender evaluation. He reported that his first sexual contact was at age 12, when his uncle and an 18-year-old male cousin \"did things\" to him while he was in foster care. They would take him to McDonald's afterward, \"so it was fine.\" By the time he was 14 or 15, he was regularly having sex with males and females who ranged in age \"from about ten to in their thirties.\"He was unable to answer whether the sexual contact was always consensual, saying, \"No one ever called the cops.\" As an adult, he said that he preferred having sex with \"young girls, because they don't fight much.\" He said that he usually only had sex with adults when he hired prostitutes or prostituted himself in exchange for money or drugs, although he said that sometimes when high, he \"might have done stuff that I don't really remember.\"The structured sex offender evaluation included penile plethysmography, assessment of visual reaction time using Viewing Time (a measure of the amount of time a person looks at a particular photo or other visual representation of a sexually stimulating situation), and a detailed interview about his sexual practices. This evaluation concluded that his main sexual attraction was to girls between the ages of 8 and 13 years.Mr. Orren's personal history was significant for multiple childhood disruptions that led to his moving into the foster care system at age 7. At age 9, his first foster mother caught him repeatedly stealing toys and bullying other children. When she reprimanded him, he hit her with a brick, knocking her unconscious. That led to placement in a second foster home. He began using drugs and alcohol at age 11. He was first incarcerated at 13, for shoplifting from an electronics store in order to obtain money for marijuana. At that point, he went back to live with his maternal grandmother, who has episodically provided him a home since then. During those 15 years, he has been arrested at least adozen times, mostly for drug possession.Mr. Orren stopped attending school in eighth grade, at about the same time that he was admitted to his first psychiatric inpatient unit. That admission was triggered by his beating his head against a wall \"to stop the voices.\" He was given a DSM-IV diagnosis of psychosis not otherwise specified, treated with risperidone, and discharged after 1 week. Soon after discharge, he discontinued the antipsychotic medication.Between the ages of 15 and 28, Mr. Orren regularly abused cocaine and alcohol and often used other substances when they were available. By the time of his arrest, he had had at least seven psychiatric admissions, always for auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions (usually of a sexual nature). It was not clear which substances he was using prior to and during these episodes of psychosis or whether they were implicated in the development of his psychiatric symptoms. He had also been admitted twice for alcohol detoxification after he went into withdrawal while unable to acquire alcohol. He was consistently nonadherent to any type of outpatient treatment. He maintained sobriety only while in hospitals or jails. When contacted by the consulting psychiatrist, his grandmother pointed out that Mr. Orren had always been \"reckless, dishonest, and angry.

He added that he was interested in his diagnoses at least partly because of his boyfriend, who was in his final year of training to be a psychiatrist.Mr. Pickering described his problems as being about \"sex and drugs; I've never cared much for rock and roll.\" Ever since high school, he described an interest in randomsexual encounters. \"Not to be narcissistic-though that's one of my diagnoses-but I am kinda hot,\" he said, \"and I play it for what it's worth.\" This led him to frequent bathhouses and bars, where he could quickly connect to attractive, anonymous partners. He described feeling aroused when watching other people having sex and added that although he had quit the habit when he entered law school, he had previously gotten a thrill out of being watched while having sex. He said he had \"hooked up\" about once a month since age 20. He said he had never once had unsafe sex with anyone aside from his boyfriend, and this led him to mention another of his \"diagnoses\": a fetishistic interest in rubber. He said condoms were great: they were virus proof, delayed ejaculation, and had an excellent smell. His interest in condoms had led him to get an outfit made entirely of rubber. He said it had been quite the hit at a bondage club, but it had made him so sweaty that he had worn it only once and had then thrown it away before his boyfriend found it. He mentioned that COVID had been isolating and terrible, but \"at least he got a chance to wear latex gloves out in public for a while, which was exciting in its way.\"He said he also enjoyed tying up his boyfriend during sex and feeling completely in control. He said he liked being a \"sadistic top\" every month or two but added that he also sometimes liked being a \"bottom\" and at other times did not feel sexual at all.Mr. Pickering said that during his occasional pursuits of anonymous sex, he had a couple of \"toxic habits.\" Whenever he went out partying, he would do a few lines of cocaine and drink about 4-6 beers. He said he always timed these \"trips to the underworld\" for times when his boyfriend went out of town, and he would have time to recover. He added that withdrawing from cocaine \"really sucks\" for a day or two, adding that he probably has \"a mood disorder related to the cocaine withdrawal.\"He added that the planning had become more complicated and that he actually had probably only gone to a club twice in the prior year. Overall, his \"social life is pretty boring. We have a lot of friends, but we're kinda like an old married couple. My only real vice is smoking. I have tried for years, but I haven't been able to get down below half a pack a day. Yawn.\"When asked to say more about himself, Mr. Pickering answered, \"Right . . . I almostforgot. I am obsessed by the hours that I work. I keep careful track so that I am among the top billers in the firm every month, and I always get my projects done on time, even if it means I don't sleep. My own theory is that it's part of my need to feel invulnerable and perfect despite being a mess on the inside.\" Mr. Pickering paused, smiled, and continued. \"That made me wonder if I'm obsessive-compulsive or narcissistic as well as having all the different paraphilias. Oh, and if hypersexuality is a diagnosis, then I'm really screwed.\"Toward the end of the initial interview, the psychiatrist said, \"I'm not sure if any of these behaviors are going to make it as a diagnosis, but I am very interested in how you feel.\" At that, Mr. Pickering welled up in tears and said he had felt sad and lonely all his life.He added that his family knew almost nothing about him, and that only a lesbian cousin-who had also moved to New York-knew that he was gay.On examination, Mr. Pickering was a well-groomed, attractive young man who was coherent and goal directed. He smiled readily but showed an appropriate affective range. He denied suicidality, confusion, and psychosis. He was cognitively very bright. His insight and judgment were viewed as intact.", "diagnosis": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \nTobacco use disorder, mild\n\nSuggested ReadingsGoldsmith SJ: Oedipus or Orestes?

While he presents with other concerns like cocaine use and workaholism, these appear secondary to the core issue of his sexual expression.  "}]
